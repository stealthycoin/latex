Whenever I write about the NSA, it is like trying to reassemble a puzzle
after the pieces have been scrambled. Thus, I am deeply grateful to the
many courageous people who helped me fit the pieces together. Although
they must be unnamed, they will not go unheard or unthanked.
   I am also very grateful to Doubleday's editor-in-chief, Bill Thomas,
for suggesting this book and for his help, encouragement, and friendship.
Many thanks also to my editor, Kris Puopolo, who helped me put the
pieces of the puzzle in their proper places and was always full of good
ideas and support. And thanks to Stephanie Bowen for her excellent eye
and help with managing the manuscript and for keeping me on schedule.
I also greatly appreciate the years of excellent advice and direction pro-
vided by Kris Dahl, my agent at International Creative Management.

                        Introduction



I n northern Georgia near the South Carolina border, a few miles from
  Leburda's Grits N' Gravy and the Cracker Barrel Old Country Store,
one of the most secret facilities in the world is undergoing a major ex-
pansion. When completed, it will likely be the largest eavesdropping
facility ever created, employing more than four thousand civilian and
military "voice interceptors" and other specialists. Run by the ultra-se-
cret National Security Agency, it is where the agency eavesdrops on the
Middle East and North Africa, thousands of miles away. Inside, behind
barbed-wire fences, heavily armed guards, and cipher-locked doors,
earphone-clad men and women secretly listen in as al-Qaeda members
chat on cell phones along the Afghan border, and to insurgents plan-
ning attacks in Iraq. They also target and record American citizens in
that region, including businesspeople, journalists, and Red Cross work-
ers, as they engage in intimate conversations with their spouses back
home and discuss confidential matters and business deals. "A lot of
time you could tell they were calling their families," said one of the
NSA intercept operators who listened in on the Americans, "incredibly
intimate, personal conversations . . . Basically all rules were thrown out
the window, and they would use any excuse to justify a waiver to spy
on Americans."
   By 2008, the NSA had become the largest, most costly, and most tech-
nologically sophisticated spy organization the world has ever known. It
had also become the most intrusive, secretly filtering millions of phone


                                    1

calls and e-mails an hour--international and domestic--through equip-
ment programmed to watch and listen for hundreds of thousands of names
and phone numbers. To sift through it all, the agency has the world's
largest collection of data-eating supercomputers. Its newest, code-named
"Black Widow," is a colossal $17.5 million Cray computer made up of
sixteen tall cabinets crammed with thousands of processors. It is able to
achieve speeds of hundreds of teraflops--hundreds of trillions of opera-
tions a second--and the NSA predicts that it will soon break the petaflop
barrier, plowing through phone calls, e-mails, and other data at more than
a quadrillion operations a second.
   In its manic drive for information, the agency requires a city-sized
headquarters complex that consumes so much energy that it is now in
real danger of running out of power and going dark. It has already run
out of space to store all of its data--data in which it is now drowning, ac-
cording to the Congressional Research Service. "Whereas some observ-
ers once predicted that the NSA was in danger of becoming proverbially
deaf due to the spreading use of encrypted communications," the report
said, "it appears that NSA may now be at greater risk of being `drowned'
in information." The report added, "Some intelligence data sources grow
at a rate of four petabytes per month now . . . and the rate of growth is
increasing." In a year at that rate, the NSA's massive database would hold
at least 48 petabytes, the equivalent of nearly one billion four-door filing
cabinets full of documents. It would also be equal to about twenty-four
trillion pages of text.
   Among the few who know just how much data flows into the NSA
is Eric C. Haseltine. The former head of Disney's "Imagineering" labs,
Haseltine was appointed as the agency's associate director for research
in 2002. Two years later he noted that even the NSA's enormous com-
puter power has trouble keeping up with the flow. "We in the NSA are
encountering problems with the flood of information that people [in the
outside world] won't see for a generation or two," he said. "We've been
into the future and we've seen the problems" of a "tidal wave" of data.
He added, "We can either be drowned by it or we can get on our surf-
board and surf it and let it propel us. And, of course, that's what we're
trying to do."
   If indeed the data flowing into the NSA is what the outside world will

see two to four decades from now, the amount of information the agency
is ingesting is truly astronomical. In fact, it may be rapidly moving from
measuring the data by the petabyte to measuring it by the exabyte, which
is 1,000 petabytes. By way of perspective, 200 petabytes is the equivalent
of all printed material. Five exabytes (5,000,000,000,000,000,000 bytes),
on the other hand, represents enough information to fill 37,000 new Li-
braries of Congress and more than all the words ever printed. This is the
annual equivalent of a thirty-foot stack of books for every man, woman,
and child on the planet.
    No longer able to store all the intercepted phone calls and e-mail in
its secret city, the agency has now built a new data warehouse in San
Antonio, Texas. Costing, with renovations, upwards of $130 million, the
470,000-square-foot facility will be almost the size of the Alamodome.
Considering how much data can now be squeezed onto a small flash drive,
the new NSA building may eventually be able to hold all the information
in the world.
   The principal end product of all that data and all that processing is a list
of names--the watch list--of people, both American and foreign, thought
to pose a danger to the country. Once containing just twenty names, today
it is made up of an astonishing half a million--and it grows rapidly every
day. Most on the list are neither terrorists nor a danger to the country, and
many are there simply by mistake. Some of the many innocent people on
the list may discover their situation when they are tossed off a plane, as
happened numerous times to Massachusetts senator Ted Kennedy. Others,
however, may never know. Instead, their application for a Small Busi-
ness Administration loan may be turned down without their being given
a reason; or the application of a bright son or daughter for admittance
into one of the military academies may be rejected without explanation;
or, because the names are shared with foreign governments, a person
could be turned away after landing in London for a vacation or business
trip--without being told why.
    Known as the Terrorist Identities Datamart Environment, or TIDE, it
is the mother of all watch lists--the watch list from which all others, in-
cluding the Do Not Fly list, are derived. Nevertheless, it sits ingloriously
on a dated and inexpensive Dell laptop in the basement of the National
Counterterrorism Center, maintained by the CIA.

  In early September 2001 there was no TIDE, and the NSA was a little-
noticed agency attempting to downsize by a third and searching for a
mission. A few days later it found its new mission--a mission that began
with a phone call intercepted from a house on a dusty backstreet in Ye-
men.

                                Sanaa



I t was late December and Yemen's capital of Sanaa lay cool beneath the
  afternoon sun. A fine powder of reddish sand, blown southward from the
vast Arabian Desert, coated the labyrinth of narrow alleyways that snake
throughout the city. On crowded sidewalks, beneath high walls topped
with shards of broken glass, women in black chadors paraded with men in
drab suit coats and red-and-white checkered scarves that hung loose like
long shawls. It is a city of well-oiled Kalashnikovs and jewel-encrusted
daggers known as jambiyahs; a place where former comrades from the
once Marxist south sit on battered sidewalk chairs chewing qat and puff-
ing from hookahs with wrinkled imams from the tribal north.
   At the northwest edge of the city in Madbah, a cluttered neighborhood
of cinder-block homes and yapping dogs, was a boxy, sand-swept house.
Across the street sat a vacant lot littered with stones, bits of concrete, and
tufts of greenish weeds. Made of cement and surrounded by a black iron
fence, the house had a solid, fortresslike appearance. On the flat roof
were three chimneys, one for each floor, and open balconies that were
wide and square, like bull pens at a rodeo; glass arches topped the win-
dows and doors.
   It was the home of Ahmed al-Hada, a middle-aged Yemeni who had
become friends with Osama bin Laden while fighting alongside him
against the Russians in Afghanistan. Hada came from a violent family
tribe based for generations in Dhamar Province, about sixty miles south
of Sanaa. In a valley of squat, mud-brick houses and green terraced farms,


                                       7

                             B O O K O N E : A T T A C K

the region was sandwiched between two volcanic peaks in the Yemen
Highlands. The area had achieved some fame as a center for the breeding
of thoroughbred horses. It also gained fame for kidnappings.
   A devoted follower of bin Laden, Hada offered to turn his house into a
secret operations center for his friend in Afghanistan. While the rugged
Afghan landscape provided bin Laden with security, it was too isolated
and remote to manage the day-to-day logistics for his growing worldwide
terrorist organization. His sole tool of communication was a gray, battery-
powered $7,500 Compact-M satellite phone. About the size of a laptop
computer, it could transmit and receive both voice phone calls and fax
messages from virtually anywhere in the world over the Inmarsat satellite
network. His phone number was 00-873-682505331; the 00 meant it was
a satellite call, 873 indicated the phone was in the Indian Ocean area, and
682505331 was his personal number.
   Bin Laden needed to set up a separate operations center somewhere
outside Afghanistan, somewhere with access to regular telephone ser-
vice and close to major air links. He took Hada up on his offer, and the
house in Yemen quickly became the epicenter of bin Laden's war against
America, a logistics base to coordinate his attacks, a switchboard to pass
on orders, and a safe house where his field commanders could meet to
discuss and carry out operations. Between 1996 and 1998, bin Laden and
his top aides made a total of 221 calls to the ops center's phone number,
011-967-1-200-578, using the house to coordinate the 1998 bombings of
the U.S. embassies in East Africa and to plan the attack of the USS Cole
in the port of Aden in 2000.
   Also living in the house was Hada's daughter, Hoda, along with her
husband, Khalid al-Mihdhar. Standing 5'6" and weighing 142 pounds,
Mihdhar had an intelligent face, with a soft, unblemished complexion
and a neatly trimmed mustache. Wearing glasses, he had the appearance
of a young university instructor. But it was war, not tenure, that interested
Mihdhar. He had been training in secret for months to lead a massive
airborne terrorist attack against the U.S. Now he was just waiting for the
phone call to begin the operation.
   Khalid al-Mihdhar began life atop Yemen's searing sandscape on May
16, 1975. Shortly thereafter, he and his family moved to the Kingdom
of Saudi Arabia. It was the beginning of the oil boom and the Mihdhars,
like thousands of others in the poverty-racked country, hoped to take ad-


                                        8

vantage of the rivers of petrodollars then flowing into the Kingdom. They
settled in the holy city of Mecca, Khalid's father was successful, and the
family became Saudi citizens.
   For centuries the Mihdhar tribe was prominent in the remote Yemen
provinces that merge invisibly into Saudi Arabia across an endless ex-
panse of drifting sand dunes. Known as the Empty Quarter, the provinces
are a geographical twilight zone, a void on the map where governments,
borders, and lines of demarcation have scarcely intruded. Horizon to ho-
rizon, there are only the occasional Bedouins who pass like a convoy of
ships on a sea of sand. In the city of Tarim is the al-Mihdhar mosque, with
its strikingly beautiful minaret reaching more than seventeen stories into
the sky, the tallest such structure in southern Arabia. It was built in honor
of the fifteenth-century religious leader Omar al-Mihdhar, the grand pa-
triarch of the tribe.
   When Mihdhar was growing up, one of his neighborhood friends was
Nawaf al-Hazmi, whose father owned a supermarket and a building in
the Nawariya district in northwest Mecca and whose older brother was a
police chief in Jizan, a city in southwest Saudi Arabia across the border
from Yemen. Darker, more muscular, and a year younger than Khalid,
he came from a prominent and financially well-off family of nine sons.
His father, Muhammad Salem al-Hazmi, described both Nawaf and his
younger brother, Salem, as "well-behaved, nice young men who have
been brought up in a family atmosphere free from any social or psy-
chological problems." Nevertheless, Nawaf would later complain that his
father once cut him with a knife, which left a long scar on his forearm.
   Soon after turning eighteen, Hazmi packed a duffel bag and left for
Afghanistan to learn the art of warfare. But by 1993 the war against the
Soviet occupiers was long over and Osama bin Laden had returned to his
contracting business in Sudan. Undeterred, Hazmi called his family from
Peshawar, Pakistan, near the Afghan border, and told them he was going
to fight in Chechnya. Very concerned, Muhammad al-Hazmi went to Pe-
shawar to bring his son home. "I went to Peshawar," he recalled. "I found
him there. He said he was staying in Pakistan as a trader of frankincense
and we returned home together. I asked him to help me in my commercial
ventures, including shops and hotels." Speaking of his sons, he added, "In
fact, I planned to open branches for them and to find brides for them. But
they did not stay for long."

   Returning to Mecca with his father, Hazmi met with a key al-Qaeda
member and in 1996, bubbling with enthusiasm, convinced Mihdhar to
join him in a new war, this one in Bosnia defending fellow Muslims from
attacks by the Serbs.
  What drove Mihdhar, Hazmi, and thousands of others was a burning
need to defend Muslim lands from the West, which had a long history, as
they saw it, of invading and occupying their territory, killing and humili-
ating their families, and supporting their corrupt rulers. The victory in
Afghanistan over the Soviets, a superpower, was their first real win and
gave many Muslims across the region a sense of unity, fueling an ideol-
ogy that viewed their separate countries as a single Muslim nation--what
they called the "ulema." An occupation or invasion of one Muslim state
was therefore an aggression against all Muslim states.
   Now with the taste of victory over Russia still sweet in their mouths,
adrenaline still pumping through their veins, and a new sense of Muslim
nationalism, many were no longer willing to sit and wait for the next en-
croachment on their lands. The West had long waged war on Islam, they
believed; now it was Islam's time to defend itself and fight back. The time
had come to go on the offensive.
   On August 23, 1996, Osama bin Laden issued his call to action: "My
Muslim Brothers of the World," he said. "Your brothers in Palestine and
in the land of the two Holy Places [Saudi Arabia] are calling upon your
help and asking you to take part in fighting against the enemy--your
enemy and their enemy--the Americans and the Israelis. They are asking
you to do whatever you can, with your own means and ability, to expel the
enemy, humiliated and defeated, out of the sanctities of Islam."
   Turning his attention to the United States, he said, "[We] hold you
responsible for all of the killings and evictions of the Muslims and the
violation of the sanctities, carried out by your Zionist brothers [Israel]
in Lebanon; you openly supplied them with arms and finance [during
Israel's bloody Grapes of Wrath invasion]. More than 600,000 Iraqi chil-
dren have died due to lack of food and medicine and as a result of the
unjustifiable aggression [the sanctions] imposed on Iraq and its nation.
The children of Iraq are our children. You, the U.S.A., together with the
Saudi regime, are responsible for the shedding of the blood of these in-
nocent children."
   The charges resonated with Mihdhar and Hazmi, and in about 1997


                                      10

                                    S A N A A

Hazmi returned to Afghanistan, formally swore his loyalty to bin Laden,
and fought against the Northern Alliance, possibly with his brother, Sa-
lem. Mihdhar followed, and swore his allegiance to the al-Qaeda leader
in 1998. They would become the elite of al-Qaeda, among the first sev-
enteen to join from the Arabian Peninsula. Bin Laden would call them
"The Founders." Early on, the al-Qaeda leader had developed a special af-
fection and trust--almost father-son at times--for Mihdhar. They shared
a common heritage, both sets of ancestors having come from the remote,
desolate Yemeni province of Hadramont.
   In the spring of 1999, bin Laden and his operations chief, Khalid
Shaikh Mohammed, worked out a plan to bring their war to the doorstep
of the enemy. Using large commercial airliners, they would in one swoop
bring mass destruction to America's financial, political, and military cen-
ters: the World Trade Center, the White House, and the Pentagon. During
the meeting, bin Laden told Khalid Shaikh that he wanted Mihdhar and
Hazmi to travel to the U.S., begin pilot training, and lead the operation.
The two were so eager to participate, he said, that they had already ob-
tained U.S. visas.
   That fall, bin Laden began setting the air attack operation in motion by
sending Mihdhar and Hazmi to an elite training course at his Mes Aynak
training facility. But Mihdhar may have been having second thoughts
about the U.S. plot. That fall he learned that his wife, Hoda, was pregnant
with their first child, and he returned to Yemen rather than continue on to
specialized training led by Khalid Shaikh. For Mihdhar, it was a complex
situation in a difficult time. His father-in-law, whose house he shared,
was one of bin Laden's most loyal supporters and ran his Yemen ops cen-
ter. And he himself was one of bin Laden's favorites and had sworn his
life to him. But all that was before the news of his future child.
   Shortly after Hazmi completed Khalid Shaikh's course, in late Decem-
ber 1999, Mihdhar was at the ops center when he received the phone call
he had been waiting for. He and Hazmi were instructed to leave in a few
days for Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, where their final, fatal mission to the
U.S. would begin. Now Mihdhar had to make a decision.
   At that moment, seven time zones and 7,282 miles to the west, the
phone call was captured and recorded by America's big ear, the ultra-se-
cret National Security Agency.

M    ichael Vincent Hayden stood at the window of his large corner of-
     fice looking west through rimless glasses with rectangular lenses.
Balding, with dark, graying hair cropped close on the sides, he had a
broad globelike forehead, cheeks that were full and friendly, and a slight
chin that quickly disappeared into his neck. At fifty-six, he was in good
shape--stood as straight as a plumb line but carried a slight paunch that
pressed tight against the buttons of his starched, powder-blue shirt. On
each shoulder was a cloth epaulet with three silver stars, the rank of an
air force lieutenant general.
   Unrecognizable to most Americans, the man at the window was the
nation's top electronic spy, overseeing more analysts and operatives than
anyone else in the country and possibly the planet. In addition to peo-
ple, he controlled the largest collection of eavesdropping tools the world
had ever known: constellations of billion-dollar satellites that could hear
whispers on a cell phone from more than twenty-two thousand miles in
space; moonlike listening posts around the globe with dozens of giant
white orbs containing satellite dishes capable of pulling in tens of mil-
lions of phone calls, e-mail messages, and faxes an hour; and, to sort it
all out, the largest collection of supercomputers on earth. In addition, he
controlled the agency's own secret military force, the little-known Cen-
tral Security Service, with its fleets of ships, submarines, and aircraft that
quietly vacuum the world for telltale voices and data.
   The vast and mysterious city stretched out below Hayden was the larg-


                                      12

                                  I N T E R C E P T

est, most powerful, and most intrusive eavesdropping machine ever cre-
ated. Made up of tens of thousands of people, more than fifty buildings,
dozens of receiving antennas, and the planet's most powerful number-
crunching supercomputers, it had one overriding goal: access. Access to
billions of private hard-line, cell, and wireless telephone conversations;
text, e-mail, and instant Internet messages; Web-page histories, faxes, and
computer hard drives. Access to any signal or device that might contain
information in any form regardless of protection--firewalls, encryption,
or passwords. Never before in history had a single person controlled so
much secret power to pry into so many private lives.
   The NSA was once a backwater agency whose director had to fight to
sit at the same table with the CIA chief, but by the time Hayden arrived
it had become the largest, most expensive, and most technologically ad-
vanced spy organization on the planet. Supplying nearly 80 percent of all
intelligence to the rest of government, it needed an entire city to house
it--a city that, if incorporated, would be one of the largest municipalities
in the state of Maryland. At the same time, it remained nearly as dark and
mysterious as when Harry Truman secretly created it, without the ap-
proval--or even knowledge--of Congress, nearly half a century earlier.
To those who worked there, NSA still stood for No Such Agency and
Never Say Anything. To those on the outside it was virtually invisible,
hidden from the world behind a labyrinth of barbed wire and electrified
fences, massive boulders, motion detectors, hydraulic antitruck devices,
cement barriers, attack dogs, and submachine gun­toting commandos in
black ninja outfits nicknamed "Men in Black."
   Inside, upwards of 30,000 employees and contractors traveled over its
32 miles of roads, parked in lots covering 325 acres, and entered one
of more than four dozen buildings containing more than seven million
square feet of floor space. More than 37,000 cars were registered in the
city, and its post office distributed over 70,000 pieces of mail a day. The
secret city's police force employed more than 700 uniformed officers and
a SWAT team, ranking it among the top 5 percent in the country in terms
of size. Its fire department responded to 168 alarms and 44 automobile
accidents the year before Hayden arrived.
   Like a powerful political boss, Hayden oversaw his city from a suite of
offices on the top floor of the agency's massive headquarters/operations
building, an interconnected maze of over three million square feet that


                                        13

                             B O O K O N E : A T T A C K

stretched in all directions. The complex is so large that the U.S. Capitol
Building could easily fit inside it--four times over. Modern and boxy, it
has a shiny black-glass exterior that makes it look like a giant Rubik's
Cube. But hidden beneath the dark reflective finish is the real building, a
skinlike cocoon of thick, orange-colored copper shielding to keep all sig-
nals--or any other type of electromagnetic radiation--from ever getting
out. Known by the code name Tempest, this protective technique, used
throughout much of the secret city, was designed to prevent electronic
spies from capturing any escaping emissions. Like a black hole, NSA
pulls in every signal that comes near, but no electron is ever allowed to
escape.
   Like the walls, the window through which Hayden was looking that
bright December morning was specially designed to prevent eavesdrop-
ping. Made of two thick, bulletproof-style panes, they contained hair-thin
copper wires to seal in even the faintest electronic whisper. And to pre-
vent sophisticated laser devices from capturing the telltale vibration of
his voice on the glass, music played between the panes.
   But despite the metal walls and unbreakable windows, when Hayden
arrived the NSA's vast city was a land under siege. Congress was lobbing
mortar rounds. Morale was lower than a buried fiber-optic cable. Senior
managers had become "warlords" and were locked in endless internecine
battles.
   Among the agency's most vocal critics was the conservative Georgia
Republican Bob Barr, who began his government career working for the
CIA. A dapper dresser with a dark-gray mustache, he was also the first
member of Congress to call for the impeachment of President Bill Clin-
ton. But a desire for privacy and the right to be left alone by the govern-
ment was as much a traditional conservative and libertarian value as it
was a core liberal principle. In May 1999, a month after Hayden arrived,
Barr stood on the floor of the House of Representatives and addressed the
issue of the NSA's spying within the U.S.
   Barr pointed a finger at an operation known as Echelon. The program,
he said, "engages in the interception of literally millions of communi-
cations involving United States citizens over satellite transmissions, in-
volving e-mail transmissions, Internet access, as well as mobile phone
communications and telephone communications. This information ap-
parently is shared, at least in part, and coordinated, at least in part, with


                                       14

                                I N T E R C E P T

intelligence agencies of four other countries: the UK, Canada, New Zea-
land, and Australia."
   The Georgia congressman then proposed legislation requiring the NSA
to turn over to the committee highly secret details about Echelon, in-
cluding "the legal standards for interception of communications . . . to
or from United States persons." Congress, Barr said, is "concerned about
the privacy rights of American citizens and whether or not there are con-
stitutional safeguards being circumvented by the manner in which the
intelligence agencies are intercepting and/or receiving international com-
munications." He added, "I ask Members on both sides of the aisle to
support this very straightforward amendment, which not only will help
guarantee the privacy rights for American citizens, but will protect the
oversight responsibilities of the Congress which are now under assault by
these bogus claims that the intelligence communities are making."
   Barr's amendment to the 2000 Intelligence Authorization Act was
enthusiastically backed by the Republican chairman of the House Per-
manent Select Committee on Intelligence, Congressman Porter Goss of
Florida, who would later be picked by President George W. Bush to head
the CIA. "It is intolerable to think of the United States Government, of
big brother, or anybody else invading the privacy of an American citizen
without cause," he warned. "I believe that the amendment offered by the
gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Barr) will help in that debate, and I am pre-
pared to accept it." Goss was also harshly critical of the NSA's refusal to
turn over Echelon documents and warned that such a denial could "seri-
ously hobble the legislative oversight process" provided by the Constitu-
tion and would "result in the envelopment of the executive branch in a
cloak of secrecy." Jumping on the bandwagon, the Republican chairman
of the House Government Reform and Oversight Committee, Dan Burton
of Indiana, then announced he would hold hearings on the NSA's Project
Echelon.
   Spurred on by the House Republicans, newspapers, magazines, and
television shows began reporting the dangers of Echelon and the NSA.
"Is Uncle Sam illicitly reading your e-mail? Listening in on your tele-
phone calls? Scanning your faxes?" asked ABC News. Even the con-
servative BusinessWeek got in on the act with an article titled "They're
Listening to Your Calls: Echelon Monitors Phones, E-Mail, and Radio
Signals." Referring to Echelon, the May 1999 article warned: "Run by


                                      15

                           B O O K O N E : A T T A C K

the supersecret National Security Agency, it's the granddaddy of all
snooping operations. Business and political leaders are waking up to the
alarming potential of this hush-hush system." The worry about Echelon
became so great among a number of privacy and civil liberties groups that
several organizations got together and created "Jam Echelon Day," where
the public was invited to flood phone lines and the Internet with words
likely to trigger the NSA's surveillance system. Among the words were
"CIA," "NSA," "assault rifle," "bomb," "assassinate," "Mossad," and even
"George Bush."
   Overseas, the European Union was alarmed by the potential of Echelon
to spy on private companies throughout Europe and pass the information
back to American competitors. In response, the EU announced it was also
launching a full-scale investigation into the surveillance network. Their
preliminary report, issued by the European Parliament, warned: "All
e-mail, telephone and fax communications are routinely intercepted by
the [NSA], transferring all target information from the European main-
land via the strategic hub of London, then by satellite to Fort Meade
in Maryland." Among those outraged was Glyn Ford, a British member
of the European Parliament. "Almost by accident we've stumbled on to
what we believe is a substantial problem for the 15 member states of the
European Union and their citizens with respect to their human rights," he
said. "We're hoping we can use our position to alert other parliaments
and people throughout the EU as to what's going on. And hopefully that
will lead to a situation where some proper controls are instituted and
[where] these things are done under controlled conditions."
   It was against such a backdrop that the NSA picked up the call to Kha-
lid al-Mihdhar in late December 1999. By then, the agency had known of
the Yemen ops center and its link to Osama bin Laden and his embassy
bombings in East Africa for more than three years. Earlier in 1999, as bin
Laden was formulating plans for a sea attack in the Yemeni port of Aden
against an American warship and the air attacks in the U.S., an intercept
from the ops center had picked up, among other things, the full name of
Nawaf al-Hazmi.
   The new message clearly identified the two people who would be trav-
eling to Southeast Asia by their first names: "Khalid" and "Nawaf." An-
other name mentioned in the conversation was "Salem," who analysts
correctly determined was Nawaf's brother. Yet despite the fact that the


                                     16

                                 I N T E R C E P T

agency had had Nawaf's full name and other details in its database for
nearly a year, no one thought to do a computer search before sending a
report on the new intercept to the CIA and FBI, and the report went out
with first names only. It was a troubling oversight given the importance of
the ops center--the place where they knew bin Laden's embassy bomb-
ing operation was coordinated--and the fact that three suspected terror-
ists, closely linked to bin Laden, were suddenly on the move to another
part of the world.
   If the agency had passed the name "Nawaf al-Hazmi" to the State
Department, analysts there would have quickly turned up the fact that
Hazmi--a suspected terrorist--had recently been issued a visa to visit the
United States. They would also have discovered that a visa had been is-
sued on almost the same day, and in the same place--Jedda--to someone
named Khalid al-Mihdhar. And now the two, along with a third suspected
terrorist, were on the move.
   But within the NSA, isolated in its rarefied world of signals and ci-
phers at Fort Meade, a universe away from rest of the spy community
in the Washington area, analysts felt it was not their job to research the
suspected terrorists' identities--unless they were specifically asked. This
despite having what was likely the largest database of intelligence infor-
mation on the planet at their fingertips. Part of the reason was hostility
toward their counterparts at the CIA's Counterterrorism Center (CTC) for
treating them not as equals but as subordinates--"like an ATM for sig-
nals intelligence," said one NSA analyst. They also were angered by the
CTC demand that they exclude their own comments on intercept reports
when in fact it was the NSA's duty to analyze the messages, not just send
out raw transcripts. Finally, NSA analysts complained, if a dispute arose
over the interpretation of an intercept, Director of Central Intelligence
George Tenet would always come down on the side of his own people at
CIA. So in this case, they did the minimum.
   The message said that "Nawaf" would fly to Kuala Lumpur on January
2 and that "Khalid" would follow three days later, on January 5, traveling
via Dubai. The NSA noted that the intelligence came from a "suspected
al-Qa'ida logistics facility" and indicated that "an operational cadre"
made up of "terrorist operatives" was planning an important meeting in
Malaysia. The NSA message added that "Salem may be Nawaf's younger
brother."

   At the CIA, there was immediate concern within a crowded, window-
less room in the basement of the agency's New Headquarters Building.
Four stories underground, Room 1W01 had no name on the door but was
known as Alec Station, set up as a "virtual station" and named after the
son of its first chief. Its purpose was to find, track, and capture or kill
Osama bin Laden. It was a bureaucratic subdivision of the agency's CTC,
and its staff, which started out at about a dozen, had doubled by 1999 and
included FBI agents.
   Alec Station viewed the move by al-Qaeda to organize a meeting in
Malaysia as both a troubling development and also an opportunity to dis-
cover the group's next move before it happened. "We knew that some
guys that looked as though they were al-Qaeda-associated were traveling
to KL," said a senior CIA official, referring to Kuala Lumpur. "We didn't
know what they were going to do there. We were trying to find that. And
we were concerned that there might be an attack, because it wasn't just
Mihdhar and Hazmi, it was also `eleven young guys'--which was a term
that was used for operatives traveling. We didn't have the names of the
others, and on Hazmi we only had his first name, `Nawaf.' So the concern
was: What are they doing? Is this a prelude to an attack in KL--what's
happening here?"
   The NSA report wound up in front of a desk officer who began seeing
connections. Because the report originated at the Yemen ops center, the
travelers were likely members of al-Qaeda. The desk officer was then
able to discover Khalid's last name: al-Mihdhar. With that information,
Alec Station dispatched a cable to CIA stations in the area. Titled "Activi-
ties of Bin Ladin Associate Khalid Revealed," it warned that "something
nefarious might be afoot" and that "Nawaf's travel may be in support of
a terrorist mission."
   The first task was to find out exactly who "Nawaf " and "Khalid al-
Mihdhar" were, so CIA station chiefs in Pakistan and the United Arab
Emirates got in touch with their counterparts in the local intelligence or-
ganizations and asked them to surreptitiously obtain copies of the men's
passports as they passed through airport immigration facilities on the way
to Malaysia. But because Hazmi changed his flights at the last minute,
and because the CIA never considered that possibility, he slipped through
the net.
   CIA officials had more luck with Mihdhar. As planned, he boarded a


                                       18

                                I N T E R C E P T

plane on January 5 at Sanaa International Airport. Landing in Dubai, he
was in the process of transferring to his flight to Kuala Lumpur when
he was pulled aside by customs officers. At the request of the American
embassy, they took his Saudi passport and secretly photocopied it before
letting him go on his way. UAE officials then passed the copy to the CIA
station chief in Dubai, who faxed it on to the CIA's Alec Station.
   What was striking was that Mihdhar's Saudi passport contained a valid
multi-entry visa for the United States. And his visa application, faxed
from the American embassy in Jedda, Saudi Arabia, showed Mihdhar's
destination was New York. Doug Miller, one of three FBI employees at
Alec Station, took one look at the faxes and became instantly alarmed. A
possible terrorist, whose travel was arranged by bin Laden's ops center,
was on his way to a secret al-Qaeda meeting and would soon be head-
ing for America's largest city. At 9:30 a.m., Miller started pecking out a
message to alert his superiors at FBI headquarters, who could then put
Mihdhar on a watch list to bar him from entry.
   But inexplicably, the message--known as a Central Intelligence Re-
port (CIR)--was spiked by his CIA boss, Tom Wilshire, the deputy chief
of Alec Station. At about 4:00 p.m., one of the CIA analysts assigned
to the station, a twenty-nine-year-old woman, typed a note onto it: "pls
hold off on CIR for now per Tom Wilshire." Without Wilshire's approval,
Miller could not pass on the information, even verbally. He had done ev-
erything by the book. A potential terrorist and member of al-Qaeda was
heading for the U.S., the FBI's jurisdiction--its turf--and he was putting
the FBI on notice so it could take action. There was no reason to kill the
message.
   Miller then told his FBI colleague Mark Rossini what had happened.
Rossini had spent many years working on terrorism cases in the bureau,
from the first World Trade Center bombing to the attacks on the U.S. em-
bassies in East Africa, and had been assigned to Alec Station for several
years. He was both perplexed and outraged that the CIA would forbid
the bureau's notification on a matter so important. "Doug came to me
and said, `What the fuck?' " said Rossini, who took the matter up with
Wilshire's deputy. (Because she is still actively working for the CIA, her
name cannot be revealed.) "So the next day I went to her and said, `What's
with Doug's cable? You've got to tell the bureau about this.' She put her
hand on her hip and said, `Look, the next attack is going to happen in


                                      19

                             B O O K O N E : A T T A C K

Southeast Asia--it's not the FBI's jurisdiction. When we want the FBI to
know about it, we'll let them know. But the next bin Laden attack's going
to happen in Southeast Asia.' " It made no sense to Rossini. The potential
terrorists were coming to the U.S.--not to Southeast Asia. Neither Ros-
sini nor Miller was questioned by the 9/11 Commission.
  "They refused to tell us because they didn't want the FBI . . . muddying
up their operation," said one of the FBI agents assigned to the station, ex-
pressing his anger. "They didn't want the bureau meddling in their busi-
ness--that's why they didn't tell the FBI. Alec Station worked for the
CIA's CTC. They purposely hid from the FBI, purposely refused to tell
the bureau that they were following a man in Malaysia who had a visa to
come to America. The thing was, they didn't want . . . the FBI running
over their case."
   The person most disliked by CIA officials in Alec Station was John P.
O'Neill, the flashy chief of the FBI's National Security Division in New
York, both for his style and his expanding turf. In his double-breasted
Valentino suits, O'Neill rubbed shoulders with the media, hung out at
celebrity-filled Manhattan watering holes, and was constantly pushing to
expand the FBI's presence overseas. "They despised the FBI and they de-
spised John O'Neill," said the FBI agent, "because of his personality, be-
cause of his style, because he was John, because they couldn't be John."
   Having forbidden Miller and Rossini from notifying their headquarters
about Mihdhar's planned travel to the U.S., the CIA then proceeded to
lose Mihdhar and Hazmi when they took off for a brief visit to Bangkok,
en route to the U.S.
   Thus Mihdhar and Hazmi had successfully dodged the intelligence ca-
pabilities of the NSA, CIA, and FBI. There was only one obstacle left:
U.S. passport control. It was the last line of defense between al-Qaeda
and America. But since Alec Station had not bothered to submit Mih-
dhar's name to the State Department for inclusion on its terrorist watch
list--and the NSA had not bothered to look up Hazmi's last name, let
alone notify the State Department--no one was looking for them. "What
we had was an al-Qaeda guy, all his passport information, and a visa to
the U.S.," said the senior CIA official, shaking his head slowly back and
forth. "If you look at the State Department standard for watch-listing, that
met it, not a question about that. And we didn't do that."
   On January 14, the chief of Alec Station told senior CIA officials that


                                       20

                                I N T E R C E P T

the search for Khalid al-Mihdhar and the others was still going strong. In
fact, it had been over for days. The next day, the FBI agent Doug Miller
sent an e-mail to Tom Wilshire asking what happened to his CIR to FBI
headquarters warning of Mihdhar's plans to travel to the U.S. "Is this a
no-go or should I remake it in some way?" he asked. He never received
a response.
  At almost that same moment, Mihdhar and Hazmi's plane touched
down at Los Angeles International Airport.

W     hen United Airlines Flight 002 pulled up to the jetway at LAX on
      January 15, Los Angeles, like the rest of the country, was taking a
nap. The long Martin Luther King weekend looked to be quiet, cool, and
wet.
    Few likely paid much attention to a front-page story in that weekend's
Los Angeles Times: "Some See U.S. As Terrorists' Next Big Target."
Written by John-Thor Dahlburg, it warned that the U.S. was increasingly
"hated by many radical Muslims" and "at the center of this web . . . is
Saudi militant Osama bin Laden." One senior French law enforcement
official noted: "Terrorism is like the weather: there are zones of high
pressure and low pressure, and they change with time. More and more in
the future, the United States is going to be a target that will replace the
traditional targets, like France." The Swiss journalist Richard Labévière
agreed and indicated that the U.S., because of its actions in the Middle
East, had largely brought the terrorism on itself. "For America," he cau-
tioned, "the bill is now coming due."
   Waved through immigration with barely a glance, Mihdhar and Hazmi
had little interest in the morning papers. Neither knew more than a few
words of English and neither had ever spent any time in a Western culture.
It is thus highly unlikely that they would have embarked on such an enor-
mously complex and important mission without having first arranged for
someone with a good command of English to help them get acclimated.
According to new information, it is quite possible that one of Mihdhar's


                                     22

own clan members had long been planning for their arrival. He may have
met them at Los Angeles International Airport, driven them to San Diego,
and helped them get settled.
  A year and a half before, in the summer of 1998, Mihdhar Mohammad
al-Mihdhar Zaid had arrived in Canada from Yemen. Fluent in English,
Mihdhar Zaid was born May 8, 1978, in a remote part of South Yemen.
Miles from any paved roads, the village of Al Hamra' was once part of
the mini-kingdom of Awsan. Several millennia later it sits forgotten in
time on a rocky edge of a dry river valley called Wadi Markha.
  Arriving in Ottawa in August 1998, he moved into a small apartment at
1067 Bakerville Drive and signed up for a computer course at Algonquin
College, a small school a few blocks away that specialized in business
and technology. Mihdhar Zaid was quiet but friendly and wore a short,
narrow, neatly trimmed beard that began at his sideburns and circled
his chin like a strap. On December 10, four months after arriving, Mih-
dhar Zaid was finishing his first semester. On a mild Thursday beneath
a heavy layer of dark gray clouds in Ottawa, he boarded a red-and-white
OC Transpo bus, got off at the American embassy, and walked out with a
visitor's (B-2) visa good for a three-month stay in America. Six days later
he boarded a plane for San Diego via Los Angeles.
   Now safe in the U.S., Mihdhar Zaid's next objective was to remain
permanently. He destroyed his Yemen passport, changed his name to Mo-
hdar Mohamed Abdoulah, and applied for asylum at a local immigration
office. He was from Somalia, he told them, where he had been subject
to harsh persecution. Eventually granted asylum, Mihdhar Zaid enrolled
in computer studies at a small local school, Grossmont Community Col-
lege.
   Passing through airport immigration control, Mihdhar and Hazmi in-
dicated that they would be staying at the Sheraton Hotel in Los Angeles.
But they never showed up. Instead, shortly after arriving--the same day,
according to an FBI chronology--they turned up in San Diego. There
they quickly became close friends with Mihdhar Zaid, who may have
met them at the airport. With the help of Omar al-Bayoumi, a Saudi who
came to the United States in 1993 and was also a close friend of Mihdhar
Zaid, the two moved into the Parkwood Apartments, Room 152. Bayoumi
then hosted a party to introduce them to the local Muslim community.
Mihdhar Zaid would later claim that Bayoumi asked him to acclimate


                                      23

Mihdhar and Hazmi to San Diego, but Bayoumi would deny it. It may
have been that Mihdhar Zaid asked Bayoumi to introduce the two to the
community.
   Mihdhar and Hazmi's new home at the Parkwood Apartments was a
two-bedroom flat in a bland, two-story building. It was located at 6401
Mount Ada Road in Clairemont, a section of the city teeming with stu-
dents and other young Muslims. Nearby was a large Islamic center, a
community college, and a row of strip clubs. Inside the apartment, except
for a television set, there was little more than bare walls and a carpeted
floor. While Hazmi was outgoing, stopping by the rental office in the
mornings to say hello to the managers and join them for coffee and cook-
ies, Mihdhar would breeze by.
   To get around, the two paid $2,300 cash for a blue 1988 Toyota Co-
rolla, purchased an insurance policy at the Huggy Bear Agency, and ob-
tained California driver's licenses. But soon the nearly $1,000-a-month
rent got too expensive. To help them, Abdussattar Shaikh, a Muslim from
India who was a retired San Diego State University English professor and
member of the local police commission, offered them a bedroom in his
house for free. Mihdhar and Hazmi agreed, but insisted on paying Shaikh
$300 a month.
   Located in the sleepy, working-class town of Lemon Grove, the house
at 8451 Mount Vernon Avenue was perched on a bluff overlooking a
valley in east San Diego County. Despite the fact that Shaikh had been a
longtime "asset" of the local FBI office, he passed on little but the first
names of his two boarders, largely because they never gave any signs of
violence or hatred of America. "They never gave me any indication of
hate," said Shaikh. "They never showed any anger, any temper." Hazmi
would often sit silently, lost in thought. "I'd ask him, `Is there something
bothering you?' He'd just smile and say, `Oh, no, no.' "
   The one person they did trust with their real feelings right from the
beginning was Mihdhar Zaid. He was apparently the only one who knew
Mihdhar's true background--including his involvement with the pro­bin
Laden Islamic Army of Aden back in Yemen. Mihdhar Zaid also shared
Mihdhar and Hazmi's anger at the U.S.
   During their time in San Diego, Mihdhar Zaid acted as their guide, tu-
tor, trusted confidant, and dining companion. Known as someone "very
quick with English" whose conversations were often sprinkled with


                                       24

American colloquialisms, he translated for them and helped them apply
for language training and, later, for flight training in Florida. He even
took them to the United Airlines ticket counter to help them trade in the
unused portions of their round-trip tickets from Kuala Lumpur to Bang-
kok. To everyone else, the two claimed they had just arrived from Saudi
Arabia.
   Mihdhar Zaid lived at the Southridge apartments, just a few miles away
from Mihdhar and Hazmi, at 7200 Saranac Street in La Mesa. A fashion-
able bedroom community east of San Diego, it was dotted with pictur-
esque restaurants, quaint antique shops, and trendy tea and coffee houses.
But like many other places around the country and around the world, just
below its placid surface there was a groundswell of anger and resentment
among young, alienated Muslims. And the anger increased every time a
U.S. submarine­launched cruise missile was fired toward Baghdad.
   In La Mesa, the epicenter for much of that anger was a Texaco gas
station on Spring Street near University Avenue, where Mihdhar Zaid
worked as assistant manager. Known as Sam's Star Mart, it had become a
hangout for bitter and frustrated young Muslims. Crowded around an out-
door picnic table, they would chat and argue and sip dark coffee. Mihdhar
and Hazmi soon became regulars and Hazmi briefly worked the pumps
himself, earning six dollars an hour.
   Soon frustrated and homesick, their few attempts at flight training a
disaster, Hazmi and Mihdhar began spending much of their time calling
back to relatives in Yemen and Saudi Arabia, usually on cell phones. Nev-
ertheless, probably out of laziness, they would also occasionally breach
security and make calls back home from the landline in their apartment.
On March 20, for example, Mihdhar used the cell phone for a sixteen-
minute call to his home at the ops center in Yemen, probably to check
on his then pregnant wife, Hoda, who lived there with her father, Ahmed
al-Hada. "Anytime you saw them, they were on their cell phones," said a
former neighbor, Ed Murray. Shaikh, their landlord, also noticed some-
thing odd: they would usually go outside when using their cell phones.
  They also spent a great deal of time surfing the Web and sending e-mail
messages over the Internet using free computers at the San Diego State
University library or else borrowing the one owned by their landlord. In
March 2000, Mihdhar signed up for WebTV Networks, a service that
would let him go online using his television instead of a computer and


                                     25

                            B O O K O N E : A T T A C K

monitor. His e-mail address was kkhd20002@yahoo.com and Hazmi's
was hzi2002@yahoo.com. It was through e-mail that Mihdhar and Hazmi
kept in communication with bin Laden's operations chief, Khalid Shaikh,
in Pakistan.
   By March, the NSA had been eavesdropping on their calls for months
without passing on their location. They were living in the home of an FBI
informant--without the FBI knowing they were there. And the CIA knew
that at least Mihdhar was planning to travel to the U.S. Worse, in early
March the CIA's Bangkok station reported to Alec Station that it had
identified one of Mihdhar's traveling companions as Nawaf al-Hazmi.
The cable reported that Hazmi had traveled to Bangkok on January 8 and
had subsequently traveled on a United Airlines flight to Los Angeles on
January 15. It also stated that Mihdhar had likewise arrived in Bangkok
on January 8 but that it was unknown if and when he had departed. Given
the circumstances, however, traveling with Hazmi to Los Angeles would
have been a logical guess--especially since they both had visas issued
about the same time from the same place.
   Now Alec Station definitely knew that one and possibly two of the sus-
pected terrorists linked to bin Laden's Yemen ops center had just flown
to California following what appeared to be a terrorist summit. Still, Tom
Wilshire never notified the FBI. Nor were any of the three FBI agents
inside Alec Station even alerted to the cables. While they had access to
the system, none had seen the messages. At that moment, Doug Miller's
CIR to FBI Headquarters was still sitting unsent in his computer. At any
time, had the FBI been notified, they could have found Hazmi in a matter
of seconds. All it would have taken was to call nationwide directory as-
sistance--they would have then discovered both his phone number and
address, which were listed in the San Diego phone directory. Similarly,
if the NSA had traced any of the incoming calls to the ops center, they
would have located two of the callers on California soil.

I t had been a bitter winter in Maryland, and icy patches of snow had
  turned General Mike Hayden's driveway into a black-and-white check-
erboard. His redbrick house on Fort Meade's Butler Street, the official
living quarters for the NSA director, had a dignified but tired look about
it. It was in a small, tree-lined enclave reserved for flag-rank officers and
off-limits to anyone else. On military bases, privates live with privates,
majors live with majors, and generals live with generals. Inside was an
eclectic mix of furniture: a shiny black cabinet from Korea, his last post,
in the living room; a long, dark wood table in the dining room that prob-
ably came from a government warehouse; and a bedroom set upstairs that
had banged around the world for a dozen or more years. In the back, pro-
tected by a flimsy carport, was the family's only car, a dark blue Volvo.
    In the NSA's Ops 2B building, counterterrorism specialists continued
reading the cryptic conversations between Mihdhar and the Yemen ops
center that had been picked up while targeting the center. But inexplica-
bly, the fact that the calls from Mihdhar had a U.S. country code and a
San Diego area code--something that should have been instantly obvi-
ous to the NSA's signals intelligence experts--was never passed on to
the FBI, CIA, or anyone else. Overly concerned about being accused of
domestic eavesdropping, Hayden made a drastic decision. He secretly
pulled the plug on intercepting all international communications to and
from the U.S., even those involving terrorism. The ban apparently went
even so far as to not reveal the fact that suspected terrorists were present


                                      27

in the U.S. Thus, as analysts and agents searched for Osama bin Laden,
they had no idea that his men were already here.
   Rather than the suave, bullet-dodging Bond in Ian Fleming's thrillers,
Michael Vincent Hayden more closely resembled a character out of a
John le Carré novel--a wizened, cynical spymaster. He also lacked the
background of the stereotypical super-high-tech spy chief. Shortly after
his arrival at the NSA, he told his staff that arithmetic had never been his
best subject. "I'll state right up front," he admitted, "I am not a math-
ematician or a computer scientist and I won't pretend to be one. I will be
relying heavily on all of you who are."
   Irish through and through, Hayden was born on St. Patrick's Day,
1945, in a predominantly Catholic blue-collar area of Pittsburgh's North
Side. Known as "the Ward," the neighborhood was near the confluence
of the city's three great rivers, the Monongahela, the Allegheny, and the
Ohio. It was an era of tin lunch buckets, steel-toed boots, and Iron City
beer; a place where smoke from coughing funnels painted the sky white
and heavy trucks hauling slag and shiny rolls of new steel made the earth
tremble. His father, Harry, worked the swing shift at the city's Allis-
Chalmers plant, applying a welding torch to giant electrical transformers,
while his mother, Sadie, stayed home to care for Mike and his brother,
Harry III, seventeen years his junior, and his sister, Debby.
   The Age of Aquarius dawned during Hayden's college years, and by
1967, as he was completing his final year, the country was undergoing a
seismic shift in social and political attitudes. In January, twenty thousand
people jammed into Golden Gate Park to hear Timothy Leary tell the as-
sembled crowd to "turn on, tune in, drop out." It would be a prelude to the
Summer of Love in Haight-Ashbury.
   Half the world away, the United States launched a bombing campaign
against the North Vietnamese capital of Hanoi as U.S. military presence
in the country exploded to nearly half a million troops. That same year
more than eleven thousand of them would return in body bags. In April,
Martin Luther King Jr. decried "the madness of Vietnam" and said it rep-
resented a "malady in the American spirit." Two months later, on June
1, Vietnam Veterans Against the War was born, and in polls taken that
summer, American support for the war fell below 50 percent for the first
time. In October, fifty thousand protesters marched across the Potomac




                                       28

to the Pentagon, which was protected by more than twenty-five hundred
army troops with bayoneted M-14 rifles. A photograph showing a pro-
tester putting a daisy into a police officer's gun quickly became an iconic
symbol of the anti-war movement.
   In Washington, the CIA launched Operation Chaos to find a link be-
tween antiwar groups and foreign interests. Soon, the program had in-
dexed 300,000 names, built up 13,000 subject files, and intercepted large
numbers of letters to and from American citizens. At the same time, the
NSA began targeting the telephone calls and telegrams of thousands of
Americans involved in peaceful protest activities, including the singer
Joan Baez, the baby doctor Benjamin Spock, and the actress Jane Fonda.
   But at Duquesne University it was as if the protests over the war and
the collapsing social order were taking place in a different dimension
of space and time. What became famously known as the "Duquesne
weekend" in February 1967 had nothing to do with a student sit-in or a
massive rally. It was the coming together of ultraconservative Pentecos-
tals and Charismatics to give birth to the Catholic Charismatic Renewal
movement, an evangelical group that promoted, among other things, the
speaking in tongues during Catholic religious services. Like many of his
religious and conservative classmates, Hayden rejected the antiwar move-
ment and the social revolution and instead would embrace the military.
   After receiving his bachelor's degree in history in 1967, he married
Jeanine Carrier, a fellow student from the village of River Grove, Illinois,
about a dozen miles from Chicago. He then stayed on at Duquesne for an-
other two years to earn his master's degree in modern American history,
writing his master's thesis on the effects of the Marshall Plan on post­
World War II Europe. As Jeanine typed up and proofread his manuscript,
Hayden drove a cab around the city, worked as a bellhop at the exclusive
Duquesne Club, and coached football at St. Peter's. When he graduated
in 1969, the war in Vietnam was continuing its slide to disaster and the
antiwar movement was growing in strength and power.
   As his family prepared to move to nearby Brighton Heights, Hayden
joined the air force. "He was so interested in history that I guess he wanted
to become part of it," said his brother, Harry. But instead of combat in
Vietnam, the young second lieutenant was sent to America's heartland:
Omaha, Nebraska, home of Offutt Air Base and the Strategic Air Com-




                                     29

mand Headquarters, where he worked as a briefer. Two years later he was
assigned to Guam. As chief of current intelligence for the headquarters of
the Eighth Air Force, he helped plan massive bombing raids against Viet-
nam. Beginning in 1975, he spent the rest of the decade in various schools,
mostly teaching ROTC at St. Michael's College in rural Vermont.
   In June 1980 Hayden, newly promoted to major, was sent to Osan Air
Base in South Korea as chief of intelligence for a tactical fighter wing.
Two years later it was back to school and then air attaché in Sofia, Bul-
garia. "I've crawled in the mud to take pictures of MiG-23s taking off
from Bulgarian airfields so I could understand what type of model it was,"
said Hayden. From there he moved into a policy job in the Pentagon
and then over to the Bush White House in the National Security Council
until 1991. After an intelligence assignment at U.S. European Command
Headquarters in Germany, he took over the Air Intelligence Agency and
became director of the Joint Command and Control Warfare Center at
Kelly Air Force Base, Texas. There he became heavily involved in the
concept of information warfare. Finally he was assigned as deputy chief
of staff for the United Nations Command in South Korea, where he dealt
with the issues of missing servicemen from the Korean War.
   Hayden was in Seoul, Korea, in late 1998 when he received a call
from George Tenet, the director of central intelligence, asking him to
come back to Washington for an interview. The meeting took place at the
Wye Plantation on the Eastern Shore of Maryland during the Arab-Israeli
peace talks. Tenet was there playing an active role but broke away for the
interview with Hayden. The CIA chief liked what he heard and Hayden
flew back to Korea virtually assured that he had the job as director of the
NSA.
   Shortly afterward, on a Friday night, he took his wife to the movie
theater at Yongsan Army Garrison. Playing was a film he had not heard
of called Enemy of the State, in which Will Smith portrays an average
citizen caught up in the NSA's secret eavesdropping net, and Gene Hack-
man is a retired NSA official worried about the agency's enormous power.
In the opening scene, the NSA's director of operations, played by Jon
Voight, assassinates a congressman who refuses to approve a bill expand-
ing the agency's power to spy on Americans. Thereafter, agency thugs
spend much of the rest of the movie doing their best to kill Smith's char-
acter, who witnessed another NSA assassination.

   "Other than the affront to truthfulness, it was an entertaining movie,"
Hayden told the author in his NSA office on February 2, 2000. "But I'm
not too uncomfortable with a society that makes its boogeymen secrecy
and power. That's really what the movie's about--it was about the evils
of secrecy and power . . . making secrecy and power the boogeymen of
political culture, that's not a bad society."
   As Hayden spoke those words, Mihdhar and Hazmi were moving into
Room 152 at the Parkwood Apartments in the Clairemont section of San
Diego and establishing communications with bin Laden's Yemen opera-
tions center. Their phone was even listed on page 13 of the 2000­2001
Pacific Bell White Pages: "ALHAZMI Nawaf M 6401 Mount Ada Rd.
858-279-5919." But Hayden's decision to secretly turn a deaf ear to nearly
all international communications entering and leaving the U.S.--even
when they involved known terrorists within the country--would have
momentous consequences.
   It would also be an area completely unexplored by the 9/11 Commis-
sion, which, astonishingly, virtually ignored the NSA in its investigation.
"No one from the commission--no one--would drive the twenty-seven
miles from downtown Washington north to the headquarters of the NSA,
in Fort Meade, Maryland, to review its vast archives of material on al-
Qaeda and terrorist threats," according to the New York Times reporter
Philip Shenon, author of the book The Commission. "There was no prob-
lem on the commission's staff finding people willing, eager, to spend
their days at the CIA's headquarters in Virginia to review its files," said
Shenon. "But no one seemed worried about what the NSA knew." He
added, "For the commission's staff, Fort Meade might as well have been
Kabul." Shenon interviewed the commission staffer Lorry Fenner, an air
force colonel with an intelligence background, who found that both the
commissioners and staff "did not understand what the NSA was and what
it did." And because Fenner herself was assigned to other tasks, the NSA
completely escaped scrutiny.
   Hayden's decision was based on his concern that the NSA would once
again be caught illegally targeting American citizens as happened in the
mid-1970s. Back then, many senior officials were read their Miranda
rights by FBI agents and came close to being prosecuted. Hayden was
also concerned about his agency's growing image as America's secret
and powerful "boogeyman." The best way to avoid both outcomes, he


                                      31

                             B O O K O N E : A T T A C K

believed, was to keep his agency's operations as far away from U.S. ter-
ritory as possible. If a terrorist in the U.S. was communicating with his
masters in a foreign country, Hayden reasoned, that was the FBI's re-
sponsibility, not his.
   But the problem was that Hayden did not coordinate coverage with
the bureau either, leaving them largely in the dark and the international
circuits to and from the U.S. largely unmonitored. And even had they
notified the bureau, the FBI, light-years behind the NSA technologically
and with little capacity for translating languages such as Arabic, would
not have been able to pick up the slack. Thus, although the NSA picked up
conversations between Mihdhar (identified as "Khalid" in NSA intercepts)
in San Diego and the ops center in Yemen by targeting the ops center, it
never made the effort to reveal where Mihdhar was actually located.
   Had the NSA wanted to, it could have easily discovered Mihdhar's
exact location in the U.S. from the technical metadata that preceded the
calls--the same information that the telephone companies use to bill
their customers. With that, they could have gotten a warrant from the
Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court and begun full-scale targeting of
Mihdhar's international communications--telephone as well as e-mail.
All that was required for a FISA (Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act)
application was showing that the targets were likely agents of a foreign
terrorist organization, an easy task since both Mihdhar and Hazmi were
being directed by bin Laden's ops center in Yemen.
   Hayden's decision was not made lightly. Almost from the moment he
arrived at the NSA, in March 1999, the agency was under seige. As the
Cold War ended and the digital age began, the NSA became a convenient
target for those fearful of the U.S. government's growing surveillance
capability. At the center of the controversy was Echelon, the agency's
system for eavesdropping on worldwide private communications, which
involved sifting through billions of telephone calls and e-mails continu-
ously zipping around the globe.
   And as Mihdhar and Hazmi landed in Los Angeles, the NSA's com-
puterized brain that ran Echelon was on the verge of a devastating aneu-
rysm.
   After dinner on Monday, January 24, 2000, a little more than a week
after the two arrived in the U.S., Hayden took a seat on his living room
couch and flipped on the television. The undefeated Syracuse Orange-


                                       32

men were scheduled to play the University of Connecticut Huskies at
the Carrier Dome on nationwide TV, and it was expected to be an excit-
ing game. But just as he sat down, his secure STU-III telephone began
buzzing upstairs in his vaultlike SCIF. Pronounced "skif " and officially
known as a Sensitive Compartmented Information Facility, it was a bug-
proof room where he could read and store supersecret NSA documents
and communicate with the agency's headquarters, about a mile away.
   Hayden inserted his black plastic crypto-ignition key into the phone,
enabling it to receive information at the highest classification level, and
in a small window the words "Top Secret Codeword" appeared. On the
other end of the line was the operations center with some very bad news.
The NSA, he was told, had just suffered a massive systemwide meltdown.
"Give me a sense," he asked. "How many computers are down?" It was
the worst possible answer. "All of them," the operations officer told him.
"The whole system is down." Hayden was in disbelief. Every computer
in the agency's secret city--including those in its two-story supercom-
puter facility--had suddenly crashed and could not be restarted. While it
was 7:00 p.m. in Washington, it was midnight deep within the computers,
which operate on Greenwich Mean Time. For some reason, at that mo-
ment a piece of software snapped, setting off the enormous shutdown.
  "It was the whole net by which we move, use, abuse, process--
everything we do with information here at Fort Meade went down," said
Hayden. "Everything on the Fort Meade campus went down. Everything!"
There was no way to minimize the problem, Hayden said. "NSA head-
quarters was brain-dead . . . This was really bad . . . We were dark. Our
ability to process information was gone." Hayden called George Tenet,
the director of central intelligence, and then immediately ordered an
emergency response. Computer scientists, electrical engineers, mathema-
ticians--anyone who could shed light on the problem was told to report
in. But then, adding to the chaos, Washington was suddenly hit by a pow-
erful snowstorm that shut down the entire federal government, including
the NSA, for two days.
   By Thursday, as snowplows finished clearing the secret city's 325
acres of parking lots and employees crowded into the seventeen thousand
spaces, Hayden wondered how to keep such an enormous disaster secret
from foes such as Osama bin Laden, who might seek to take advantage of
the agency's sudden deafness. "I called [NSA director of corporate com-


                                    33

                             B O O K O N E : A T T A C K

munications] Bill [Marshall] in here and I said, Bill, I need a concept; we
need to communicate this to the work force," he recalled. "What should
we do?" Marshall suggested a town meeting. "And that's exactly what
we did."
  Taking the stage in the William F. Friedman Auditorium, Hayden
warned everyone not to breathe a word about the crash. "I said the fact that
we're down is an operational secret. Our adversaries cannot know that our
intelligence capabilities have been crippled." He pulled no punches. "We
are the keeper of the nation's secrets," he told the code breakers and the
intercept operators, the cryptolinguists and the area specialists. "If word
of this gets out, we significantly increase the likelihood that Americans
will get hurt. Those who would intend our nation and our citizens harm
will be emboldened. So this is not the back half of a sentence tonight that
begins, `Honey, you won't believe what happened to me at work.' This is
secret. It does not leave the building!"
  That night, Hayden and his wife, Jeanine, took a long drive to the
Stone Manor, a romantic inn near Frederick, Maryland. It was their thirty-
second wedding anniversary and he had long ago made the dinner res-
ervations. But on the drive back to Fort Meade, he received a call from
his deputy director for technology, Robert Stevens, who said he needed
to speak to Hayden on a secure line the minute he arrived home. A short
while later, Hayden climbed the stairs to his SCIF and dialed Stevens
on his STU-III. Despite the fact that the system was slowly improving,
Stevens believed the fix was going in the wrong direction and wanted
permission to bring the whole system down once again and start all over.
Hayden agreed, but by then the NSA's customers were becoming hungry
for their daily ration of secrets.
   Desperate for intelligence, Hayden's deputy, Barbara McNamara, con-
tacted the agency's British partner, GCHQ (Government Communica-
tions Headquarters). "We actually got in touch with them," she recalled,
"and said: `Would you please ensure that the information that you are pro-
viding in support of military operations or ongoing world events, crises,
conditions, also gets to our customers here in the U.S.?' " Meanwhile,
on the second floor of the Tordella Supercomputer Building, scientists
pulled apart spaghetti-like mazes of multicolored wires, covered desks
and floors with unwieldy schematics and wiring diagrams, and probed,
millimeter by millimeter, the nervous systems of the computers. The hard


                                       34

                                   D E A F

work paid off and the cause of the crash was pinpointed to an outdated
routing protocol. The solution was a massive hardware and software up-
grade.
   On Friday, after spending thousands of man-hours and $1.5 million
in repairs, the network was patched together. After more than three days,
the NSA awoke from its electronic coma, its memory still intact. But
like water faucets stuck in the open position, millions of intercepts per
hour had continued to pour down from the agency's satellites during the
crash--enough data every three hours to fill the Library of Congress. But
instead of being processed and analyzed, they were simply collected in
vast memory buffers capable of storing five trillion pages of data.
  "We had the ability to store that which we collected over this three and
a half day period," said Hayden. "When we were able to go back and
process the information when that capability came back, it took eight
to twelve hours to process and analyze the information that we had col-
lected." Hayden concluded, "The network outage was a wake-up call."
Others familiar with the NSA's fragile state of technology agreed. "We
went deaf for seventy-two hours because of an antiquated system that
should have been upgraded years ago," said Tim Sample, staff director of
the House Intelligence Committee.
   The next day, as Hayden and his wife went cross-country skiing on
the nearby Fort Meade golf course, the supercomputers in the Tordella
complex continued crunching through the mountains of backlogged data.
Batches of intercepts at last arrived on analysts' desks. And in the agen-
cy's counterterrorism center, the bin Laden specialists finally began read-
ing the communications between Mihdhar and the Yemen ops center.
   Hayden spent much of the spring defending his agency from attack-
ing Republicans. On April 12, 2000, he took the witness chair in an open
session of the House Intelligence Committee. It was a rare sight. The last
time an NSA director had appeared in such a setting was a quarter of a
century before, when another air force general, Lew Allen, squirmed in
his seat from hostile questions about decades of illegal spying. Deter-
mined not to let that happen to him, Hayden ensured that his agency's
giant ears were pointed as far away from the U.S. as possible. Rather than
tens of thousands of targets in the U.S., as some reports had speculated,
the NSA was targeting only about three individuals within the country. It
was a cautious approach, made necessary because of the enormous focus


                                    35

                             B O O K O N E : A T T A C K

on the NSA by Hollywood, the media, and Congress. But caution also
had its dangers; terrorists might be missed--terrorists like Mihdhar and
Hazmi.
   Committee chairman Porter Goss, a Republican from Florida, led off
the hearing with a bit of humor. "There are concerns that the NSA oper-
ates in a very secret environment, without any oversight or legal strictures
in place to guide and control their conduct," he said. "These concerns
were dramatized quite notably in the recent film Enemy of the State--a
very exciting motion picture. Considering the fact that the character play-
ing me was killed off in the first half hour of the film, I am very pleased
to report that the movie was nothing more than a very entertaining work
of fiction, and we'd like to keep it that way."
   But Goss quickly got down to why they were there. "Congress im-
posed the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 upon the NSA
and other elements of the intelligence community because the NSA was
found during the sixties and seventies to have engaged in indiscriminate
electronic surveillance of U.S. persons. This was not a good period. This
was not a proper thing."
   Sitting arrow-straight in the witness chair, three silver stars on each
shoulder flashing in the television lights, Hayden immediately went on
the defensive. "What I'm here to tell you today," he said, "is that the laws
and regulations under which we operate are, one, observed, and two, suf-
ficient for both our conducting our mission and conducting it in a way
that protects the rights guaranteed by the Fourth Amendment . . . The law
requires us to do everything we can to prevent touching American privacy
even at the very front end of that process, in the collection."
   Hayden then addressed the charges that, as he put it, "NSA illegally
spies on American persons." A key issue, he noted, was the definition of
"American person." "We use the phrase within the agency that we protect
the rights of American persons. Now, let me define in more detail who
is an American person . . . An American person is an American citizen
anywhere. An American person is also a permanent resident alien of the
United States." To make his point, Hayden used an example. "Let me put
a fine point on this. If, as we are speaking here this afternoon, Osama bin
Laden is walking across the Peace Bridge from Niagara Falls, Ontario,
to Niagara Falls, New York, as he gets to the New York side, he is an
American person. And my agency must respect his rights against unrea-


                                       36

                                   D E A F

sonable search and seizure, as provided by the Fourth Amendment to the
Constitution."
   It was an ironic example. As Hayden was speaking that afternoon,
bin Laden's men had already arrived. Just two days earlier in San Diego,
Hazmi took his first flight lesson. And three days later he would receive
a wire transfer of $5,000 from bin Laden's moneyman in the United Arab
Emirates to continue the lessons.
   Hayden's testimony was deliberately aimed at disarming his critics,
but it was also misleading. His hypothetical suggested that NSA eaves-
droppers would have to remove their earphones the second bin Laden
stepped onto U.S. territory and became a "U.S. person." In reality, the
NSA would be monitoring his every move, before, during, and after his
arrival. While he was a foreigner in a foreign country--Canada--the
agency would have had no legal problem eavesdropping on him. And as
he walked into New York, the agency could have continued monitoring
his communications without skipping a beat. FISA allowed for emer-
gency eavesdropping without a warrant for up to two days. In that time,
the agency could have easily obtained a full FISA warrant to continue the
surveillance because of bin Laden's status as someone associated with a
foreign terrorist organization, al-Qaeda.
  Another sensitive area Hayden touched on was data mining--obtain-
ing telephone calling records from the phone company--which he said
was illegal. "The information you get in your phone bill, if it is about an
American person, is beyond my reach. It is protected communication," he
said. "All that comes about by the statutes and laws that are provided to
us. They all devolve from the Fourth Amendment, FISA, Executive Order
12000, which indeed was promulgated in 1981, but has been reviewed by
every administration, Democratic and Republican, since that time. And
then finally by USSID 18, United States Signals Intelligence Directive
18, which takes the provisions in those broader statutes and executive
orders and turns them into a specific cookbook that can be understood
by every eighteen- or nineteen-year-old airman, soldier, sailor, or marine
who comes to work for the National Security Agency."
   Finally, Hayden brought up one area that appeared to be a giant loop-
hole, if a president wanted to secretly take advantage of it. It was simply
to have one of the NSA's partners in Canada, Britain, or another country
eavesdrop on targets beyond the legal reach of the NSA and then pass the


                                    37

                              B O O K O N E : A T T A C K

information back to the agency. Such an action had been considered in
the past. In 1973, for example, the CIA refused to help the NSA illegally
eavesdrop on American citizens within the U.S. But according to the
NSA's deputy director at the time, Dr. Louis Tordella, they could have
done it using foreigners in a foreign country. Hayden suggested that such
activity was not prohibited by federal law. Instead it was prohibited only
by presidential executive order, and executive orders can be canceled or
changed at the whim of a president. "By executive order," Hayden said,
"it is illegal for us to ask others to do what we cannot do ourselves, and
we don't do it."
    By the end of the hearing, Hayden had succeeded in convincing the
committee and much of the public that his agency had not become the
Orwellian nightmare portrayed in the movies. There was also little ques-
tion, however, that all it would take for life to imitate art was a few secret
decisions. But as he made his way out of the hearing room on that crisp
afternoon in April 2000, the NSA director had no idea that his agency's
greatest threat came not from studio executives in Hollywood, but from
a pair of flight students 125 miles farther south in San Diego. "Mike
Hayden's challenge," noted George Tenet at the hearing, "is not only to
manage today, but to get ready for the next century . . . and anticipate
how our adversaries will surprise us."

B   ored with life in San Diego, Mihdhar was getting anxious about his
    wife, Hoda, whom he would call often. Then in late May he learned
that he had just become a father for the first time and he made the deci-
sion to return to Yemen and see his new daughter. Notified of this deci-
sion, Khalid Shaikh was infuriated. Not only was his soldier planning to
go AWOL in the middle of the operation, Mihdhar's partner would be
left abandoned in San Diego. Mihdhar, who barely knew Khalid Shaikh
but was very close to bin Laden, ignored his demands to remain. Besides,
he told him, there would be no problem in returning since he had not
overstayed his visa. In a mad rush, Mihdhar pulled all $4,888.69 from his
bank account and gave it to Hazmi, transferred the Toyota's registration
to him as well, and then made plane reservations.
   On June 9, Mihdhar piled his bags in the back of the Toyota and set off
for Los Angeles with Hazmi driving and Mihdhar Zaid giving directions.
After spending the night at a motel, the next morning they drove to Los
Angeles International Airport. At the time, the idea of hijacking a plane
from there was still being considered as part of the ultimate operation.
Thus, soon after entering the terminal the three began casing it out. One
stood near the security area with a video camera and slowly began turning
in a circle to capture the entire panorama.
   At 2:15 p.m., Mihdhar boarded Lufthansa Airlines Flight 457 for
Frankfurt, where he would change for Flight 636 to Kuwait and then on
to Sanaa, where Hoda and his new baby daughter were waiting.

  Abandoned by his friend Khalid, Hazmi remained in San Diego like
a jilted lover. By December 2000, he had been there almost a year. As
Mihdhar saw his new baby in Sanaa, took part in the bombing of the USS
Cole in Aden, and was busy in Saudi Arabia recruiting a dozen or more
soldiers for the operation, Hazmi spent his days in his small Lemon Grove
room. During the day he would surf the Internet on his landlord's com-
puter following the news of fighting in Chechnya and Bosnia, call home
and send e-mails, pump gas with Mihdhar Zaid at Sam's Star Mart--and
wait. He had long ago given up any idea of becoming a pilot and had even
stopped taking English lessons. But he continually received messages
from Khalid Shaikh--and later from Tawfiq bin Attash, another top bin
Laden lieutenant--that the operation was still going forward and that he
would soon receive a new partner.
   Six months earlier, at the start of the summer, the man picked to run
the operation, Mohamed Atta, arrived on the East Coast and began flight
training with a number of his associates. For bin Laden, it was good for-
tune falling in his lap. At the same time that it seemed neither Mihdhar
nor Hazmi were going to become pilots, Atta and a number of his friends
applied to join al-Qaeda. Fluent in English, well educated, and with a
technical background, Atta seemed the perfect candidate to take over the
operation. While Mihdhar recruited the soldiers in Saudi Arabia, Hazmi
would become Atta's deputy--as soon as they found him a partner.
   Finally, as the early snows of winter pushed deep across the country,
Hazmi received the e-mail from Tawfiq bin Attash that he had been wait-
ing for, and a few weeks later, on December 8, Delta Airlines Flight 43
from Paris touched down at Cincinnati's international airport. On board
was Hani Hanjour, a quiet, determined twenty-nine-year-old on a stop-
over from Dubai to San Diego. Medium height and weight with short
black hair and dark, soulful eyes, he was returning to a place very familiar
to him, a place where he had once lived with a family in Florida, studied
English in California, and earned his commercial pilot's license in Ari-
zona.
   Hanjour was born in 1972 into a prominent family of landowners and
food supply merchants. The middle child of seven, he lived in a sprawling
two-story villa on a tree-lined street in Al Faisaliyah, an upscale neigh-
borhood in Saudi Arabia's summer capital, Taif. For many Saudis, Taif is
a place to escape to, a cool mountain refuge a mile above the sweltering


                                      40

                                    M E S A

streets of Mecca. Set in a hollow between granite hills rising from the
eastern slope of the Hejaz, it is also a city where the old and new have
achieved a degree of harmony. Ultramodern marble and glass govern-
ment offices tower over old mud homes with wooden louver windows
and carved wooden doors. Elsewhere are pink palaces and the Corniche,
a road that spirals down the sheer cliffs of the Taif escarpment to the fiery
sandbox below.
   Like the rest of the operatives, Hanjour was a member of the first gen-
eration of Muslims to witness the successful defeat of an invading West-
ern superpower, shoved back across its border like a bully pushed out of
a school yard. Growing up, their heroes were the men who at last stood
up to the West, drew a line in the sand along the Afghan border, and then
succeeded with little more than dented Kalashnikovs and worn sandals.
   By the time Hanjour reached his teenage years, in the late 1980s, he
was off to Afghanistan to join in the fight. But by then the Soviets had
been defeated and he instead spent six weeks working for a relief agency.
His battle would have to wait for another time and place.
   Following the war in Afghanistan, buoyed by the victory over the
mighty Soviet empire, many in Hanjour's generation turned their atten-
tion to another superpower with a long and unsavory history in the Mid-
dle East: the United States. The list of grievances was long. There was
the CIA's coup that overthrew Iran's democratically elected leader and
replaced him with the brutal quarter-century reign of the Shah and his Sa-
vak secret police. Then there was the unstinting support, backed by cash
and carrier strike forces, for the region's most despised and corrupt dicta-
tors. And then the harsh sanctions imposed on Iraq that had no effect on
Saddam Hussein but brought death and illness to hundreds of thousands
of the young and poor. And finally it was America's iron-fisted support
for Israel's half century of humiliation, oppression, and occupation of the
Palestinians as well as its wars, occupation, and massacres in Lebanon.
   For Atta, the breaking point came in April 1996 with the start of Isra-
el's massive bombardment of Beirut and Arab villages in southern Leba-
non in an attempt to end the shelling of northern Israel by Hezbollah.
   In the southern Lebanese town of Qana, the attack turned horrific, and
while largely ignored by the American press, it made the front pages of
newspapers throughout Europe and the Middle East. "It was a massacre,"
said a front-page story in London's Independent. "Israel's slaughter of


                                     41

                             B O O K O N E : A T T A C K

civilians in this terrible 10-day offensive--206 by last night--has been
so cavalier, so ferocious, that not a Lebanese will forgive this massacre."
   Even some in the Israeli press were harshly critical of the attack. Ar-
ieh Shavit, a columnist for the Israeli daily newspaper Ha'aretz, noted:
"How easily we killed them [in Qana] without shedding a tear. We did
not denounce the crime, did not arrange for a legal clarification, because
this time we tried to deny the abominable horror and move on." And
the international edition of Time magazine noted, "Around the Middle
East . . . Qana is already a byword for martyrdom."
   For Atta, Israel's Grapes of Wrath invasion was the final shove, push-
ing him over the edge. He was "enraged," said his friend and fellow stu-
dent Ralph Bodenstein. Shortly after the invasion began, Mohamed Atta
walked to the al-Quds mosque in Hamburg, Germany, with several of his
friends and signed his last will and testament, naming it his "Death Cer-
tificate." He was twenty-seven years old. According to one of his friends,
by signing the will during the attack he was offering his life as a response
to Israel's invasion. All that was left was to find the right target.
   For millions throughout the region, their emotions had been deprived
of expression for decades. Afghanistan showed them there was an alter-
native. To Hanjour, Atta, Mihdhar, Hazmi, and the rest, the United States
was their generation's Soviet Union, and they dedicated their lives to con-
tinuing where the last generation left off. As America bombed Berlin and
Tokyo during its great war, they would bomb New York and Washington
during theirs.
   It was dark when Delta Flight 1661 passed over Balboa Park and fi-
nally touched down on Lindbergh Field in San Diego. For Hani Hanjour,
it was the end of a long journey, but it was also a journey to the end.
   There, happy to greet him, was Nawaf al-Hazmi, who after six long
months finally had a new partner, a new companion, someone who knew
his secret. His time in purgatory was over; the operation was again mov-
ing forward. They were also both in a hurry. Now as second in command
under Atta, Hazmi was concerned because the soldiers Mihdhar was re-
cruiting and preparing would start arriving on the East Coast in the spring
and they had to be there to handle them. And Hanjour, the last of the
pilots to arrive--half a year after the others--knew he needed to catch
up very fast on his flying and was eager to get back to Arizona for a few
months of practice.

                                    M E S A

   Within a day, and with little time to rest from his exhausting flight,
Hanjour climbed into Hazmi's aging blue Corolla--now packed with all
his belongings--as they prepared for a long cross-country odyssey. But
first Hazmi made a last trip back to his rooming house in Lemon Grove
to bid farewell to his friend and landlord, Abdussattar Shaikh. Introduc-
ing Hanjour simply as "Hani," Hazmi told Shaikh that they were headed
north to San Jose to take flying lessons and that he would stay in touch,
and he promised to return soon. Next they stopped by Sam's Star Mart,
where Hazmi now introduced Hanjour as a "longtime friend from Saudi
Arabia." After he said his good-byes to Mihdhar Zaid and the rest of the
crowd, they were off.
   On December 12, they pulled into Mesa, Arizona, where Hanjour was
going to begin his training on multi-engine aircraft. At Jet Tech, a com-
pany in nearby Phoenix that offered instruction using a highly sophis-
ticated Boeing 737-200 simulator, Hanjour couldn't wait to get started.
Strapped in his pilot's seat, he perfected his turns, his control, and his sta-
bilization. Pushing the throttles fully forward, he also perfected his speed
and his aim as he prepared for his first multi-engine solo, and his last.

F  ar away from Hayden's modern suite high atop Ops 2B, Rich Taylor's
   ornate, wood-paneled office was almost a museum piece. Located on
the second floor of Ops 1, it was in the agency's original A-shaped build-
ing, now the home of its signals intelligence directorate. When the agency
first moved to Fort Meade in the late 1950s, at a time when even its name
was top secret, it was the office of the director. A few years later, during
the Cuban missile crisis, it was where many intercepts of both the Rus-
sian naval forces and the Cuban missile crews were read.
   As the NSA's deputy director for operations, Taylor was Hayden's
electronic spymaster. A native of Kentucky and a 1969 graduate of the
Air Force Academy, Rich Taylor spent five years in the air force before
signing on with the NSA as a program manager in the agency's research
and engineering organization. From then on he spent nearly his entire
career involved with the NSA's satellite eavesdropping program, from
design of the spacecraft during several years at the National Reconnais-
sance Office to analysis as the manager of the overhead systems division
within the operations division. He then became the executive director,
the agency's number three position. But the choice job in the agency had
always been the chief of the operation directorate, where all the action
happened--which Taylor took over in November 1997.
   Frustrated by the agency's lumbering bureaucracy, Taylor sent a long
and secret memorandum to Hayden within weeks of the general's ar-
rival outlining his view on fixing the agency's growing problems. "We


                                     44

                               T H I N T H R E A D

need help," he wrote. "The first and most important issue for NSA/CSS
[Central Security Service] is to reform our management and leadership
system . . . we have good people in a flawed system." Next, he said, was
"strengthening and leveraging our strategic alliances," in other words,
working more closely with the CIA and the NSA's foreign partners, such
as GCHQ.
   The problem with the foreign partners, Taylor complained, was the
NSA's tendency to leave them in the dust both operationally and techno-
logically. "The U.S. maintains the lead, both in technology and opera-
tional readiness," he said. "We bring our partners along." By not helping
them keep up, Taylor suggested, the NSA might one day lose their coop-
eration. Finally, because so much of the NSA's success in the age of the
computer depended on getting secret access to foreign machines, data-
bases, and software--with the help of the CIA's clandestine officers--it
was more important than ever to closely merge the two disciplines. "Our
relationship with CIA is absolutely vital to our future success," he wrote.
"It is essential that NSA and CIA put our relationship on a sound basis."
    Before Hayden arrived, Taylor had been tackling the issue of how best
to reduce the ocean of intercepts flowing into the agency and at the same
time have the ability to trace back the suspicious calls to the U.S., in-
cluding those from Yemen, without violating the law. Code-named Thin-
thread, the project was intended to develop complex digital filters to sift
through the Nile-size rivers of phone calls, e-mail, faxes, and other com-
munications signals channeled into the agency by satellites and ground
stations. Made up of diabolically complex mathematical algorithms and
protocols, these filters would isolate and trap the key conversations and
messages while discarding the rest, unheard and unread.
   The system was designed for intercepting communications within or
between foreign countries. But Thinthread also had a unique component
that allowed the agency to trace signals back to the United States with-
out violating the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. That law forbade
monitoring communications to or from individuals in the U.S. without a
warrant. The catch-22 was that to get a warrant the agency needed prob-
able cause, but without being able to intercept the message and follow it
to its U.S. destination there was no way of knowing to whom or where it
was going. And without that information, there was no way to apply for
a warrant.


                                       45

                              B O O K O N E : A T T A C K

   The idea behind Thinthread was that the agency would automatically
encrypt the body of all the messages and phone calls entering and leav-
ing the U.S., thereby protecting the privacy of the content. All that would
be visible would be the "externals," the exact destination or origin of the
communications. As a further safety check, Thinthread also employed an
automated auditing system to ensure that analysts were not abusing the
system and "peeking" at the contents.
  With such a system, the agency would be able to see the links between
suspected targets overseas and destinations in the U.S. without the abil-
ity to read the contents of the communications. And if a pattern began to
emerge--such as frequent calls and e-mails from the Yemen ops center
to several phone numbers and computers in San Diego--that would be
enough to show probable cause that the people in San Diego were agents
of a foreign terrorist organization. With that, the agency could then obtain
a FISA warrant to identify the individuals, decrypt the contents of the
communications, and begin reading and listening to the complete mes-
sages and phone calls. At the same time, the FBI could begin its own
investigation on the ground. The system would also allow the agency
to target those communications that simply transited through the U.S.,
such as an e-mail from Frankfurt to Mexico City via the Internet hub in
Miami.
   Tests of the program throughout 1998 proved very successful and Tay-
lor advocated for its full implementation. But when Hayden arrived the
following March he flatly opposed it. His opposition was largely based
on objections by his legal staff, who felt the program pushed the agency
too close to the edge. Hayden also had a personal desire to avoid even
the appearance of eavesdropping on Americans in America, which he
considered the FBI's responsibility. Instead of Thinthread, he came up
with a different concept to help with the information overload problem.
Code-named Trailblazer, the project, like Thinthread, attacked the mas-
sive data flowing into the agency with a combination of powerful com-
puters and complex filtering software. But where Thinthread encrypted
all traffic entering, leaving, or transiting the U.S.--thus allowing the NSA
to analyze where it came from and where it was going without violating

minated in a "very emotional debate" between Taylor and Hayden, with
the director siding with the lawyers. Taylor, pushed out of his position
by Hayden, then decided to leave the agency altogether at the end of De-
cember, the same month that the NSA released a request for proposals to
defense contractors to begin bidding to work on Trailblazer.
   Hayden knew the agency was in trouble. "We are digging out of a deep
hole," he said. "NSA downsized about one-third of its manpower and
about the same proportion of its budget in the decade of the 1990s. That
is the same decade when packetized communications--the e-communi-
cations we have all become familiar with--surpassed traditional com-
munications. That is the same decade when mobile cell phones increased
from 16 million to 741 million--an increase of nearly fifty times. That
is the same decade when Internet users went from about 4 million to 361
million--an increase of over ninety times. Half as many landlines were
laid in the last six years of the 1990s as in the whole previous history of
the world. In that same decade of the 1990s, international telephone traf-
fic went from 38 billion minutes to over 100 billion."
   Out of those 100 billion minutes, however, the NSA needed only a few
dozen to discover and stop bin Laden's planned air attack--and those few
dozen were sitting nearby in a cavernous tape library collecting dust.

O   n February 21, 2001, Hani Hanjour was awarded his certificate for com-
    pleting sixty hours of Boeing 737-200 Systems Ground Training. At Jet
Tech in Phoenix, he underwent lengthy sessions in the company's Boeing
737-200 simulator at $250 an hour, as well as classroom study. Although
his performance sheet has no checkmarks in the box opposite "Taxi," it
does contain a large check opposite "Steep Turns," which, for Hanjour, was
far more of a priority. In his final evaluation, his instructor noted that "Hani
absorbed a great deal of information and is very intelligent," but, he con-
cluded, "he will need much more experience flying smaller a/c [aircraft]
before he is ready to master large jets." With his commercial pilot's license
in his pocket and advanced training in flying a passenger jetliner, Hanjour
was now up to speed with the other three pilots. To celebrate, he and Hazmi
drove to the Grand Canyon for some sightseeing.
   As Hanjour trained in the simulator, Hazmi was busy with research.
He sent away to Sporty's Pilot Shop in Batavia, Ohio, for training videos
for Boeing 747-200, Boeing 747-400, and Boeing 777-200 flight decks,
as well as a video titled "How an Airline Captain Should Look and Act."
But both he and Hanjour were now anxious to get to the East Coast as
soon as possible. Hazmi needed to begin making preparations for the
cadre of soldiers his friend Khalid al-Mihdhar would soon be sending his
way. At the same time, Hanjour would be able to get in some additional
flying time on smaller aircraft at local airports. Getting ready for the trip,
Hazmi drove down to Wide World of Maps in Phoenix and purchased a

National Geographic road atlas, a Unique Media map of the United States
and another of New York City, and a world aeronautical chart covering
the northeast portion of the United States.
   Around dawn on Sunday, April 1, they departed Mesa in their bat-
tered blue 1988 Toyota Corolla, packed with wrinkled shirts, blue jeans,
and flight videos. The two turned onto I-40, the 2,400-mile highway that
wraps the country's heartland in a ribbon of asphalt. For Hazmi and Han-
jour, it was a road to war, a payback for treating their lands as little more
than gas stations for road-hogging SUVs and targets for military fire-
power. To them, it would become a road to redemption.
   Because it was Sunday, they were able to make good time as they
dashed through New Mexico and then into the northern tip of Texas, zip-
ping past miles of monotonous scrub plains and farmlands. When they
crossed into Oklahoma at about 5:30 p.m., the sun was beginning to set
behind them, and the road ahead grew dark as Hazmi cruised along at
about eighty-five miles per hour. Approaching Elk City, they tripped the
radar in the car of C. L. Parkins, an Oklahoma Highway Patrol trooper.
Parkins stayed with them for a dozen minutes; then at 6:06 p.m. he pulled
Hazmi over. "I asked him to come back to my car and he sat there, and I
visited with him a little bit," Parkins recalled. Hazmi appeared calm and
collected and Parkins thought he spoke English well. "We did our normal
checks--check to see if the vehicle's stolen, check to see if he's wanted,
if his driver's license status is valid--try and see if there's anything we
need to look further into."
   Apparently, no one was looking for him--not the NSA, CIA, or FBI,
or the State Department. Thus, said Parkins, "we didn't see anything to
go any further with the contact . . . I wrote him a ticket for speeding and
the seat belt." Hazmi promptly mailed in his tickets with money orders
covering the $138 in fines to the Washita County court clerk and the mat-
ter was quickly forgotten.
   Hazmi and Hanjour were lucky; America's intelligence system was
broken. Six year earlier another Oklahoma Highway Patrol trooper,
Charles Hanger, made a similar routine stop not far away and arrested
Tim McVeigh less than two hours after he blew up the Murrah Federal
Building in Oklahoma City. Although at the time no one knew he was
responsible, McVeigh was put in jail for carrying an unregistered hand-
gun. Two days later, before McVeigh made bail, the FBI named him as


                                       49

                            B O O K O N E : A T T A C K

a chief suspect and immediately flashed his name to law enforcement
organizations around the country. As a result of the quick actions by FBI
and police, McVeigh never got away.
   Back on I-40, Hazmi pressed ahead. In some ways, the car's occupants
were a study in contrasts. Hanjour was dour, secretive, often unapproach-
able, with a tendency to cut Hazmi off when he thought his partner was
becoming too open with strangers. He could sit for hours in the car with-
out speaking, his hat pulled tight on his head. Hazmi was the extrovert,
outgoing, made friends easily. He liked to wear colorful shirts, have a
coffee with friends, laugh. More puzzled than annoyed, he would always
ask why when Hanjour cut him off.
   As the odometer spun, there would be no stopping at motels, just cat-
naps at rest stops. The soldiers would be coming soon and Hazmi needed
to find a place to put them up where they could blend into the background.
It was also essential to get them some type of ID, perhaps even driver's
licenses, so they would have no problem boarding the planes.
   Two days after they left Mesa they reached Front Royal, Virginia, on
the outskirts of Washington. Hazmi got gas and Hanjour withdrew $100
from a cash machine with his Citibank card. It was an easy way to get
access to the $11,000 deposited into his UAE Citibank account by bin
Laden's moneyman in Dubai. Hanjour also had another $9,600 in a Saudi
British bank account. Back on the road, they continued for another hour
to the Hillwood Motor Lodge, a decaying relic of the 1950s awaiting the
wrecker's ball, just off Sleepy Hollow Road in the busy Seven Corners
section of Falls Church, Virginia, a suburb of Washington.
   On May 2, Hazmi and Hanjour drove their blue Toyota Corolla to
Washington's Dulles Airport to meet United Flight 925 from London, ar-
riving at 7:40 p.m. On board were the first two members of Hazmi's crew,
Majed Moqed, a law student at King Saud University in Riyadh, and
Ahmed al-Ghamdi, a university student in Mecca who grew up in a prom-
inent family in the southern Saudi city of Beljurashi. They had flown into
Britain on Emirates Airlines Flight 1 from Dubai. Hazmi was no doubt
happy to have some additional friendly faces around. On the previous
evening he had been mugged in front of his apartment by a man who had
been hanging around his place for several weeks. He immediately called
the police and when the Fairfax County officers showed up, he gave his
full name and his current address. No one, however, was ever arrested.

                                   T O T O W A

   The arrival of the two soldiers put more pressure on Hazmi to quickly
find a good location near New York City for the other members of his
crew as they began arriving. To help them out, Eyad al Rababah, some-
one they met at a local mosque, suggested that the pair consider Paterson,
New Jersey, and agreed to take them there and show them around. "It was
somebody asking you for a favor, and you don't lose anything by saying
yes," he said. Still, Rababah thought it was odd that while they professed
to be practicing Muslims, he never saw them engaged in prayer. "Even in
the mosque, I never saw them praying," he said. Then when he showed up
at their apartment for the trip he received another surprise: instead of two
there were now four of them. On the morning of May 8, Rababah headed
north with Hanjour seated next to him in his Honda Civic, and Hazmi fol-
lowed behind in the Toyota Corolla with Moqed and Ghamdi.
   Seven hours later they pulled into Rababah's new hometown of Bridge-
port, Connecticut, where he got them registered at the nearby Fairfield
Motor Inn and took them on brief tour of Paterson, about ninety minutes
away, and to dinner there at a Chinese restaurant. After returning them to
the hotel, Rababah said good-bye and left Hazmi and his crew to make
their decision. They got right to business, making over seventy-five local
phone calls to area flight schools and real estate firms. Joe Macy, owner
of the inn, recalled that his guests "behaved very gentle-like."
   For Hazmi and Hanjour, Paterson seemed just the place to disappear.
An old, gray industrial town of 170,000 residents, it contained thousands
of new immigrants attracted by the low cost of housing and, for some
without the right papers, the promise of anonymity. Begun in 1792 as a
sketch on the drawing board of Alexander Hamilton, two hundred years
later the city's eight square miles contained seventy-two distinct nation-
alities, a polyglot of cultures and languages, colors and hair styles, smells,
sounds, and tastes. The two liked the gritty, blue-collar neighborhoods of
African Americans and Hispanics. Also nearby was a growing Middle
Eastern community and just twenty miles northwest was New York City.
   For $650 a month, they rented a one-room apartment at the top of an
aging three-story redbrick building at 486 Union Avenue. With graffiti on
the white door and pried-open mailboxes in the hallway, it sat on a shabby
block in Totowa, next to Paterson. Down the street was St. Mary's, a Ro-
manesque, ochre-colored church decorated with pots filled with yellow
mums. It had been built a century before, when the area was predomi-


                                       51

                             B O O K O N E : A T T A C K

nantly German and then Irish. Newly arrived Hispanic families now filled
the pews and overflowed onto the sidewalk on Sundays. Nearby was Inner
City Blues, a clothing store selling hip-hop Phat Farm sweatshirts, and
across the street was a storefront converted into an Islamic mission where
Muslim men, mostly from Bangladesh, kneeled for afternoon prayer.
   Moving into Apartment R3 on May 21, Hazmi, Hanjour, Moqed, and
Ghamdi attracted little attention. But Jamie Diaz, who lived one floor
below, noticed that they only brought with them two carry-on bags and
a dark green garbage bag stuffed with clothing. They had no furniture
for the unfurnished apartment and their only major purchase was a used
air conditioner for thirty dollars. Nevertheless, for the next three months,
as the dreary flat became the operations center and living quarters for
Hazmi's growing crew, he and the others blended in with little difficulty.
   Dressed in jeans, shirts, and sometimes sandals, they would walk be-
neath the yellow awning of the bodega on the first floor to buy water,
soda, juice, bread, toilet paper, napkins, and individually wrapped dough-
nuts--sometimes half a dozen at a time--or load up with Chinese food in
brown stapled bags from the nearby Wo Hop III restaurant. Hanjour and
Ghamdi would frequently stop in El Fogon, a Mexican restaurant a few
doors down Union Street, where owner Modesta Gomez would sell them
packs of Salem or Parliament cigarettes and Budweiser beer.
   Totowa also had the advantage of being between two local airports
with flight schools, each only about a fifteen-minute drive, and Hanjour
was eager to climb back into the cockpit. On the very day they moved into
their new apartment, Hanjour drove the eight miles to Air Fleet Train-
ing Systems in Teterboro, New Jersey, where he started receiving ground
instruction. His goal was to fly solo along the Hudson Corridor, a low-
altitude "hallway" along the Hudson River that passes such New York
landmarks as the World Trade Center. But heavy traffic in the area can
make the corridor a dangerous route for pilots with insufficient experi-
ence. Over the next few weeks he would fly along the corridor with an
instructor and eventually do a solo run. He then switched to Caldwell
Flight Academy eight miles in the opposite direction in Fairfield, New
Jersey, where they permitted him to rent aircraft, and for much of June,
Hanjour continued to improve his flying skills.
   Now certain of his decision to complete his mission, Hanjour decided
to make a final phone call to his family back in Saudi Arabia so they


                                       52

                                  T O T O W A

would not become suspicious. Telling his mother he was calling from a
pay phone in the United Arab Emirates, where they believed he had gone
in 1999 to find a pilot's job, he said he would telephone again when he
had his own number. He might, he added, return home for a visit in about
a month.
  With Hazmi now settled in Totowa and Atta living in Florida, the two
decided it was time for their first summit meeting to coordinate the vari-
ous attacks. It would also be their first face-to-face meeting. Until then,
both communicated via cell phones and e-mail, using public computers
at libraries, Internet cafés, or Kinko's. When Atta arrived in June 2000,
he went into Manhattan and purchased a Motorola "flip" cell phone plus
a fifty-dollar prepaid calling card from Datavision Computer on Fifth Av-
enue. The number, 646-479-0432, was activated the next day, and Atta
quickly used it to call back to the Middle East more than a dozen times.
   After about a month he got rid of what was, in essence, a throwaway
phone. From then on he primarily relied on more secure untraceable
calling cards, bought for cash at grocery stores and pharmacies, and pay
phones when calling back to the Middle East. Thus, while in New Jersey
to meet with Hazmi, Atta called his sister in the Middle East from a pay
phone at the busy Cibao grocery store on Union Avenue in Paterson. He
then made several other calls to the UAE from a wall phone near a stack
of tires at Happy's Garage in Elmwood Park. In all, the group used at
least 133 different prepaid calling cards, defeating the NSA's ability to
track them.
  When communicating with each other, Hazmi and Atta would always
talk in coded language, but there was only so much they could discuss
in such a limited way. So both had hoped to get together in April when
Hazmi first arrived in Virginia, but they just could not find the time.
Finally, on June 19, Hazmi went to Newark International Airport and
boarded Continental Airlines Flight 1471 for Miami.
   Around the same time, bin Laden decided to put the United States and
Israel on notice about his planned attack, as he had done prior to previ-
ous attacks. In June, Bakr Atyani, the Pakistan bureau chief for the Lon-
don-based MBC-TV network, received an unusual message asking if he
would like to interview Osama bin Laden. The Arabic-language network
was widely watched throughout the Middle East and the Islamabad-based
journalist had reported on both bin Laden and the Taliban in the past.


                                      53

                             B O O K O N E : A T T A C K

Atyani agreed, and on June 21 he drove to Chaman, a dusty Pakistani
frontier town just across from Afghanistan.
   Eighty miles from Quetta, with its cool air scented with jasmine, Cha-
man was reached by a road that cuts through a low, wide desert plain of
sun-bleached bluffs, sandy dunes, and deep gullies. It then climbs sharply
up the eight-thousand-foot Khojak Pass, finally reaching the border post
situated at the crest and often hidden in a shroud of sandstorms. There Aty-
ani was placed in a car with blackened windows and driven for hours over
a rock-strewn road with near-meteor-size potholes toward Kandahar--and
then three hours more into the desert, past slowly moving waves of sand.
   The final destination was a mud-walled room in a remote compound.
Atyani was greeted by bin Laden, who rose from a series of low silky
cushions splashed with color. Also greeting him was bin Laden's deputy,
Ayman al-Zawahiri, and his military chief, Muhammad Atef, who Atyani
thought was "a very sharp person." After a mensaf--an Arabian dish of
rice and meat--bin Laden said that because of an agreement with the
Taliban, he would not give any press statements. Then he added, "You are
here because there is some material which we are going to give you and
some news."
   Then Muhammad Atef gave Atyani the news in the form of a stark
warning. "The coming weeks will hold important surprises that will tar-
get American and Israeli interests in the world," he said. Atyani knew that
meant a coming attack. "I am 100 percent sure of this, and it was abso-
lutely clear they had brought me there to hear this message," he later said.
He then asked bin Laden to confirm the message but, in keeping with his
agreement with the Taliban, he just smiled off camera. Bin Laden seemed
"happy with the talk of his aides," said Atyani.
   Atef indicated that he was aware of the consequences of such an action.
"We are expecting an American strike," he said. But the men in the camps
were able to "dismantle their equipment and move to other hideouts in
less than half an hour," he added. Jamal Ismail, another journalist work-
ing as a television correspondent in Pakistan at the time, recalled that
some bin Laden aides informed Atyani unofficially that they hoped the
attack would be of great assistance to the Palestinians in their struggle
against Israel. "We have big plans for the Intifada," they said. "We are
going to strike against American interests more than the Cole."

                                Chatter



I n late June, the NSA suddenly picked up a large number of very worri-
  some intercepts, filled with talk of attacks, throughout the Middle East.
"Unbelievable news coming in weeks," said one intercept. "Big event--
there will be a very, very, very, very big uproar," said another. "There
will be attacks in the near future," said a third. At the same time, bin
Laden also released an al-Qaeda-made videotape that opened with shots
of the USS Cole shortly after its attack by suicide bombers eight months
earlier and included shots of terrorist training exercises. Bin Laden then
declared: "To all the mujahideen, your brothers in Palestine are waiting
for you; it's time to penetrate America and Israel and hit them where it
hurts most."
  The "chatter" and bin Laden's warning hit Hayden like a thunderclap.
He knew that shortly before the embassy bombings, bin Laden had al-
lowed in a reporter from ABC News and offered a similar warning, which
was also followed by a great deal of chatter from target areas. But now
bin Laden's warning was crystal clear to anyone who listened to it: he
was intending "to penetrate America" and hit it "where it hurts most"--
likely Washington and New York. As the NSA sent reports of the chatter
throughout the national security community, red alerts began flashing.
  At the State Department, a "Worldwide Caution" was issued regarding
the risk of terrorist attack and specifically mentioning groups linked with
bin Laden and al-Qaeda; U.S. military forces throughout the Persian Gulf




                                      55

                             B O O K O N E : A T T A C K

were placed on a heightened state of alert; a Marine Corps contingent
in Jordan cut short its training session and returned to its ships; the U.S.
Fifth Fleet sent its ships out to sea from ports in Bahrain.
   While worrisome signals had been arriving for weeks, the red flag went
up on Thursday, June 21. Top-secret intercepts of confidential messages
exchanged between the reporter Bakr Atyani in Islamabad and MBC-TV
in London, likely picked up by GCHQ--Britain's NSA--revealed bin
Laden's latest dire warning. NSA analysts were well aware that similar
warnings had preceded the attacks on both the U.S. embassies in East
Africa and the USS Cole.
   Immediately the agency flashed major alerts about "UBL"--Usama
bin Laden--throughout the national security community. The U.S. Cen-
tral Command raised the force protection condition level for U.S. troops
in six countries to Delta, the highest possible level. A U.S. Marine Corps
exercise in Jordan was halted. U.S. embassies in the Persian Gulf con-
ducted an emergency security review, and the embassy in Yemen was
closed. The State Department's Foreign Emergency Support Teams were
readied to move on four hours' notice and kept up the terrorism alert pos-
ture on a "rolling twenty-four-hour basis."
   On Friday, the CIA sent out a cable to all its stations. "Threat UBL
Attack Against US Interests Next 24-48 Hours," it said. The same day the
FBI issued its own warning to its field offices in its daily "UBL/Radical
Fundamentalist Threat Update." More CIA warnings continued on Satur-
day. "Bin Ladin Attacks May Be Imminent," said one. "Possible Threat
of Imminent Attack from Sunni Extremists," said another.
   On Sunday, June 24, Bakr Atyani's report on MBC-TV finally aired,
triggering a cacophony of chatter throughout the Middle East. On Monday,
the warnings throughout Washington continued: "Bin Ladin and Associ-
ates Making Near-Term Threats," said a CIA cable. It reported multiple
attacks planned over the coming days, including a "severe blow" against
U.S. and Israeli "interests" during the next two weeks. And at the White
House, longtime National Security Council counterterrorism coordina-
tor Richard Clarke sent a Terrorism Threat Update to National Security
Advisor Condoleezza Rice indicating the possibility of near-term "spec-
tacular" terrorist attacks resulting in numerous casualties. He also said
that six separate intelligence reports showed al-Qaeda personnel warning
of a pending attack.


                                       56

                                  C H A T T E R

   Clarke believed that the detailed threats contained in the intercepts
were far too sophisticated to be merely a psychological operation to keep
the United States on edge, a view with which the CIA agreed. The inter-
cepts were incredibly consistent: the attacks would be calamitous, causing
the world to be in turmoil, and would consist of possible multiple--but
not necessarily simultaneous--attacks.
   On Thursday, June 28, Clarke wrote to Rice that the pattern of al-
Qaeda activity indicating attack planning over the past six weeks "had
reached a crescendo." "A series of new reports continue to convince me
and analysts at State, CIA, DIA [Defense Intelligence Agency], and NSA
that a major terrorist attack or series of attacks is likely in July," he noted.
Finally, two days later the headline of a briefing to top officials pulled no
punches: "Bin Laden Planning High-Profile Attacks." The report stated
that bin Laden's operatives expected near-term attacks to have dramatic
consequences "of catastrophic proportions."
  At the NSA, where intercepts containing frightening new threats
appeared almost every three days, the tension seldom let up for Mike
Hayden. "Throughout the summer," said Hayden, "we had more than
thirty warnings that something was imminent." But the questions were
always the same--where, when, and how?

F  or Hazmi, the Fourth of July would be a reunion. Stepping off Saudi
   Arabian Airlines Flight 53 at JFK that morning was his old buddy and
partner Khalid al-Mihdhar. Now that all of the soldiers were in the U.S.,
it was time for Mihdhar to rejoin Hazmi and his crew. With no problems
going through passport control, Mihdhar may have enjoyed the irony of
arriving on the day America celebrated its independence, casting off its
British shackles. He had come to help break his lands free of America's
shackles. In another touch of irony, Mihdhar listed as his U.S. address
the Marriott Hotel at the World Trade Center. In fact, Hazmi would put
him up at the Quality Hotel Eastside, a low-cost hotel a few blocks from
another skyscraper, the Empire State Building.
   For the American intelligence community, it was yet another humili-
ating blunder. Once again, the U.S. embassy in Jedda, Saudi Arabia, is-
sued Mihdhar a B-1/B-2 (tourist/business) visa. And once again he was
able to enter the U.S. and disappear, just as he had done more than a
year and a half earlier. In all that time, his name had never been placed
on a watch list. Prior to obtaining the visa, Mihdhar had obtained a new
"clean" passport, but like the previous document it also contained a secret
coded indicator, placed there by the Saudi government, warning of a pos-
sible terrorist affiliation. U.S. passport control officers, however, had no
knowledge that such a code system existed. In addition, his visa applica-
tion contained at least one false statement, indicating that he had never
traveled to the U.S. before. And his passport was technically invalid since


                                      58

                                 C A M B R I L S

it had no expiration date (apparently an accident)--a fact the inspector
at JFK failed to notice that could have triggered closer scrutiny or even
barred him from entry.
   That evening, Hazmi drove Atta to Newark International Airport for
his 6:30 p.m. Delta flight back to Fort Lauderdale, where his crew had
been enjoying a few days off. While Wail al-Shehri was driving through
Lion Country Safari, his brother Waleed al-Shehri and Satam al-Suqami
were working out at Body Perfect Fitness Center, and Marwan al-Shehhi
was purchasing pornographic videos at Video Outlet in Deerfield Beach,
where he became a regular customer.
   A few days later, with the complete team now assembled in the U.S.,
Atta boarded Swissair Flight 117 from Miami to Zurich, where he would
change planes for Madrid. He was traveling to Spain for a summit with
Ramzi Binalshibh, his former roommate and the man who was helping
bin Laden and Khalid Shaikh Mohammed coordinate the operation from
his base in Germany. Making use of his two-and-a-half-hour layover, he
withdrew 1,700 Swiss francs from an ATM, bought a box of Swiss choco-
lates, and began looking for sharp knives in the duty-free store. One that
caught his eye was a red Swiss Army Camper Knife that featured a large
blade, a sharp, jagged saw, and nearly a dozen other attachments. The
other was a Swiss Army Soldier's Knife, which also had a large stainless-
steel blade but was more compact. Atta took both of them. He then tele-
phoned Marwan al-Shehhi back in Florida and learned that Binalshibh, in
Hamburg, had been unable get a ticket to Madrid because of the holiday
travel season. The only thing available was a ticket the next day to the
small Catalan city of Reus on Spain's Costa Dorada, its Gold Coast. Atta
figured the easiest thing would be to simply drive there to meet him. At a
computer stand in the airport, he logged on to Travelocity and reserved a
car in Madrid from July 9th to the 16th.
   Atta landed at Madrid-Barajas Airport in the early afternoon on July 8,
too late to leave on the long drive, so after using a public Internet terminal
he stopped at a small airport travel kiosk to find a hotel. What he wanted,
he told the woman at the counter, was the hotel that was cheapest and
closest to the airport. The travel agent called the Diana Cazadora, a three-
star hotel near the cargo terminal, confirmed the reservation, and showed
Atta where to wait for the minibus. After checking into Room 111, he
called Binalshibh to confirm that everything was still on schedule for the

meeting the next day. Then the following morning he paid cash for the
hotel room, slid behind the wheel of a silver Hyundai Accent rented from
the SIXT agency next door, and got started on the three-hundred-mile trip
to the Mediterranean shoreline.
   At 7:00 p.m., the small Aero Lloyd plane carrying Binalshibh pulled
into the Reus Airport, a single terminal ringed by olive groves. There to
greet him was Mohamed Atta. The two then drove to the tiny seaside vil-
lage of Cambrils on the southern outskirts of Salou. By the time they ar-
rived, the exodus of tourists from the town's long, honey-colored beaches
was over and the sidewalk cafés were starting to buzz. It was a good
place to become invisible in plain sight, lost among the constantly chang-
ing faces, like cards in a shuffle. Arriving without reservations, Atta and
Binalshibh found a space at the four-star Hotel Monica, overlooking six
miles of gentle surf, and they checked into Room 412.
   Despite the carefree nature of the venue, their weeklong series of meet-
ings was deadly serious. Binalshibh told Atta that bin Laden wanted the
attacks carried out as soon as possible because he was concerned about
the large number of operatives in the U.S. at the same time. But Atta said
he was still unable to provide an exact date for the attacks because he
was too busy organizing the arriving soldiers. In addition, he still needed
to coordinate the timing of the flights so that the crashes would occur
simultaneously. Atta said he needed about five to six more weeks before
he could provide an accurate attack date.
   In whispered talk in their room and along the beach, Binalshibh told
Atta that bin Laden wanted the date of the attack kept from the other op-
eratives until the last minute and that Atta was to provide Binalshibh with
advance notice of at least a week or two. In that way Binalshibh could
travel to Afghanistan and report the date personally to bin Laden. Turning
to targets, Binalshibh reminded Atta that one of bin Laden's chief aims
was to destroy the White House. Atta said its low position surrounded
by taller buildings made it a difficult target, but he had asked Hazmi and
Hanjour to evaluate its feasibility and was awaiting their answer. He ex-
plained that Hanjour had been assigned the Pentagon and he and Hazmi
had rented small aircraft and flown reconnaissance flights near the build-
ing.
  With regard to the rest of the targets, Ziad Jarrah would crash into the
Capitol and both he--Atta--and Marwan al-Shehhi would hit the World


                                       60

                                 C A M B R I L S

Trade Center. In the event a pilot could not reach his intended target, he
was to crash the plane wherever he could. Atta said that if he was unable
to strike the World Trade Center, his plan was to crash his jet directly into
the streets of New York. Each pilot, he said, had volunteered for his as-
signed target, and the assignments were subject to change.
   A few days after they arrived, they were told the hotel was fully com-
mitted for the rest of the week and they would have to find a new place
to stay. Climbing into the silver Hyundai, they drove a few miles up the
coast toward Tarragona and turned onto the Via Augusta and into the
Hotel Sant Jordi, a small, amiable establishment near the sandy shore of
Playa Sabinosa. The hotel had space and the clerk handed Atta the keys
to Room 206.
   Turning to the mechanics of the hijackings, Atta said he, Shehhi, and
Jarrah had encountered no problems carrying box cutters on cross-coun-
try surveillance flights. During those flights, he said, the best time to
storm the cockpit was about ten to fifteen minutes after takeoff, when the
cockpit doors typically were opened for the first time. Because he was
confident that the doors would be open, he said, he had not planned for
any contingency actions, such as using a hostage or claiming to have a
bomb. In looking for planes, Atta said he wanted to select aircraft depart-
ing on long flights because they would be full of fuel, and that he wanted
to hijack Boeing aircraft because he believed them easier to fly than the
Airbus, which he understood had an autopilot feature that did not allow
them to be crashed into the ground.
   Finally, Atta confirmed that all the soldiers had arrived in the United
States without incident. He said he planned to divide them into teams ac-
cording to their English-speaking abilities, and in that way they would be
able to assist one another before the operation. Each team would also be
able to command the passengers in English. One problem Atta brought
up was the desire by some of the pilots and soldiers to contact their fami-
lies to say good-bye, something he had forbidden.
   Before they parted, Atta expressed his concern about his communica-
tions being intercepted. To help reduce the threat, he instructed Binalshibh
to obtain new telephones as soon as he returned to Germany. One phone
would be used to contact him in America and the other would be used to
speak with the leaders in Afghanistan and Pakistan. Binalshibh then gave
Atta eight necklaces and eight bracelets that Atta had asked him to buy


                                      61

when he was recently in Bangkok. He believed that if the hijackers were
clean shaven and well dressed, others would simply stereotype them as
wealthy Saudis and give them less notice.
  By the time they were finished it was Monday, July 16, and Atta drove
Binalshibh back to the Reus Airport for his Aero Lloyd flight back to
Hamburg. It would be the last time they would ever see each other. Five
years earlier, as Israel began its bloody Grapes of Wrath invasion of Leba-
non with American support, Atta had signed his last will and testament
vowing revenge. It was time for the endgame.

                               Warning



I f June was a bad month for Mike Hayden, July was even worse; the chat-
  ter was indicating that an attack could happen any day. What caused the
sudden spike in warning indicators was the news on June 20 that Presi-
dent Bush had invited Israeli prime minister Ariel Sharon to the White
House--their second meeting--while at the same time once again snub-
bing Palestinian leader Yasir Arafat. There were few people on earth bin
Laden detested more than Ariel Sharon, and as a result he sent a strongly
worded letter to Khalid Shaikh Mohammed ordering that the attack take
place in July as a statement of support for the Palestinians.
   It was the second time bin Laden exploded over Israel and ordered the
immediate launch of the attack. The first time was in October 2000, while
Atta and the other pilots were still undergoing flight training. The trigger
that time was the killing of twelve-year-old Mohammed al-Dura, a Pales-
tinian boy in Gaza who was shot by Israeli troops when gunfire broke out
between the Israeli forces and Palestinian civilians. The entire event was
captured by a French television camera crew and then broadcast around
the globe, setting off a firestorm throughout the Middle East. The news
also quickly reached Afghanistan, sending bin Laden over the top. As an
act of revenge, he ordered Khalid Shaikh to immediately launch the at-
tack in the U.S., even though none of the pilots had yet been trained. He
argued that now was the time to make their point, and it would be enough
for them to hijack the planes and then simply crash them into the ground,
killing everyone on board, rather than fly them into specific targets. Kha-


                                     63

                             B O O K O N E : A T T A C K

lid Shaikh, however, was not willing to throw away years of planning and
work for a quick moment of revenge, and he talked bin Laden into keep-
ing the original timetable.
   Now, as a result of the Sharon visit to the Bush White House and the
snub to Arafat, bin Laden was again on the warpath. His order this time
was so serious that a general warning went out through his training camps
in Afghanistan. His al-Farooq camp suddenly went on a high state of alert,
and trainees began practicing evacuation drills. At the moment their com-
manders gave the order, they would run to the gates of the compound and
into the mountains where they would remain until it was safe to return.
Al-Qaeda members dispersed with their families, security was increased,
and bin Laden moved to a safe location. But in the end, Khalid Shaikh
once again succeeded in keeping the air attacks in the U.S. on track, argu-
ing that the teams were not ready, and the alert was called off.
   As the alert was taking place, Khalid al-Mihdhar was in Saudi Arabia,
having flown there from Sanaa on May 26 to spend about a month tak-
ing care of some final details. While there, he told his cousin in Mecca
about the coming attacks in the U.S. He said that five were planned and
that they had originally been scheduled for May and then July (because
of Sharon) and finally September. "I will make it happen even if I do it
by myself," he quoted his mentor, bin Laden. Finally, Mihdhar asked his
cousin to watch over his home and family because he had a job to do.
   At the end of July, the NSA issued a report noting that the spike in
intelligence about a near-term al-Qaeda attack had stopped, and Hayden
breathed a sigh of relief. At the White House, Richard Clarke passed the
report on to Condoleezza Rice and her deputy, Stephen Hadley, warning
that the attack had just been postponed for a few months "but will still
happen."
   A few days later, on August 1, the FBI issued an advisory that although
most of the reporting indicated a potential for attacks on U.S. interests
abroad, the possibility of an attack within the United States could not be
discounted. The CIA brought the same issue to the president's attention
five days later when it included a report in its President's Daily Brief
(PDB) titled "Bin Ladin Determined to Strike in U.S." It was the thirty-
sixth time so far that year that bin Laden or al-Qaeda had been discussed
in a PDB.
   In the August 6 brief, the CIA noted that bin Laden had warned that


                                       64

                                 W A R N I N G

"his followers would follow the example of World Trade Center bomber
Ramzi Yousef" and "bring the fighting to America." Also, after the U.S.
missile strikes on his base in Afghanistan in 1998, bin Laden "told fol-
lowers he wanted to retaliate in Washington." At another point the docu-
ment discussed a 1998 report indicating that bin Laden "wanted to hijack
a U.S. aircraft to gain the release of `Blind Shaykh' Umar Abd al-Rah-
man and other U.S.-held extremists." Finally, the PDB noted that "FBI
information since that time indicates patterns of suspicious activity in
this country consistent with preparations for hijackings or other types of
attacks, including recent surveillance of federal buildings in New York."
Despite the wake-up call, the president showed little interest.
   As the lights flashed and the sirens wailed from the tops of the spy fac-
tories, some of the analysts and operatives inside began attempting to put
the pieces together. At the CIA, Khalid al-Mihdhar and Nawaf al-Hazmi
had never been far from the thoughts of Tom Wilshire, the deputy chief of
Alec Station. In January 2000 he had spiked the message drafted by Doug
Miller, one of the FBI agents assigned to the station, alerting his head-
quarters to Mihdhar's U.S. visa and New York travel plans. Wilshire also
never alerted the State Department, which would have put Mihdhar on a
watch list and stopped him at the border. Then, when Wilshire learned in
March 2000 that Hazmi had actually flown to Los Angeles two months
earlier, he again failed to notify the FBI or even the agents working for
him in his office.
   In May, Tom Wilshire was transferred to FBI headquarters as the
CIA's chief liaison to the bureau's counterterrorism division. Soon after
he arrived, he began focusing closely on the Kuala Lumpur meeting out
of concern that al-Qaeda might next target a location in Southeast Asia.
Shortly before Wilshire left Alec Station, Margarette Gillespie began
"getting up to speed" on the Malaysia meeting, too. An FBI IOS (intel-
ligence operations specialist) detailed to Alec Station as a desk officer,
she had been asked to help Wilshire on the project in her spare time. That
meant reading all the relevant cable traffic and reviewing the stack of
memos and e-mail messages previously sent.
   Looking for something but unsure of just what, on May 15 Wilshire
downloaded the March 2000 cable indicating that Mihdhar and Hazmi
had traveled from Malaysia to Bangkok on January 8, 2000. From there,
according to the cable, Hazmi flew to Los Angeles a week later. Con-


                                     65

                             B O O K O N E : A T T A C K

sidering how concerned Wilshire was about the meeting, it seems aston-
ishing that he would not be interested in why Hazmi might have flown
to Los Angeles and what he was doing in the U.S. And yet there is no
evidence that he was.
  To help him unravel the mysteries surrounding the meeting in Kuala
Lumpur, Wilshire turned to Dina Corsi, one of the FBI's intelligence op-
erations specialists at headquarters. Because the information gathered by
the FBI's criminal investigators would be used to prosecute people and
put them in jail, or even execute them, they needed to show to a court
a high degree of likelihood--"probable cause"--that the target of their
investigation was involved in criminal activity. Only after that burden
was met would a judge in a criminal court issue a warrant authorizing
electronic surveillance or a physical search.
   Signals intelligence specialists at the NSA, on the other hand, looked
for information not to put someone in jail but to discover threats from
foreign governments or foreign terrorist organizations. As a result, their
requirements for obtaining an eavesdropping warrant--known as a FISA
warrant--were much less stringent. Instead of criminal courts, attorneys
from the Justice Department representing the NSA would appear before
the highly secret Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court. There, rather
than demonstrate that their target was involved in criminal activity, all
they would have to show is that he or she was connected in some way
to a foreign government or foreign terrorist organization and that useful
intelligence would result from the eavesdropping. The burden was lower
because the consequences were fewer; privacy would be breached but no
one would be going to jail.
  The worry had always been that overeager criminal investigators, hop-
ing to get a tap on a suspect with little or no probable cause, would simply
apply for a FISA warrant by showing some nebulous foreign connec-
tion--for example, that the person works for a company headquartered
in London. They would then be able to, in essence, go on a fishing expe-
dition by listening in on the person's communications for three months,
hoping to find something--anything--in that time. The Constitution, un-
der the Fourth Amendment, protects against such unreasonable searches.
  To keep the two types of eavesdropping activities--intelligence and
criminal--completely separate, an artificial "wall" was created. This was




                                       66

                                  W A R N I N G

designed to prohibit those monitoring private conversations with much
easier FISA warrants from "cheating" by passing their result "over the
transom" to criminal investigators, who required a much tougher prob-
able cause standard for a criminal warrant.
   Beginning in October 2000, as a result of extremely sloppy and ques-
tionable work by the FBI, the FISA court ordered the wall between the
FBI's criminal investigators and the NSA's eavesdroppers heightened
considerably. The court found errors in approximately one hundred appli-
cations for FISA warrants, mostly in affidavits submitted by FBI super-
visory special agents. The errors involved both omission of information
and misrepresentations about criminal investigations of FISA targets.
In addition, instead of having separate criminal and intelligence squads
working on separate criminal and intelligence investigations, FBI agents
were constantly moving back and forth between groups. This was exactly
what was prohibited.
  To remedy the situation, the FISA court issued a new order. It now
required that anyone who reviewed FISA material, such as transcripts
of the NSA's FISA-authorized domestic electronic surveillance, sign a
certification acknowledging that the court's approval was required before
the information could be shared with criminal investigators. The FBI then
decided to allow only agents and analysts assigned to intelligence duties
access to FISA materials, not the criminal investigators.
  At the NSA, Hayden had looked at the new requirements with an-
guish. From then on, before the agency could send intercept reports to
the FBI, it would first have to review the documents, determine whether
any of the information in them came from FISA surveillance, and then
include a warning notice, or "caveat." Still, because the agency only had
a few--less than half a dozen--FISA-authorized domestic surveillance
targets at the time, the additional work would be minimal. All that needed
to be done was to put a warning notice on those limited intercepts while
leaving the thousands of others unchanged.
  The NSA soon discovered a drastic way around the minor inconve-
nience. Instead of simply placing the warning notice, or caveat, on just
the data from the FISA-authorized targets, it would put the notice on all
counterterrorism-related intelligence provided to the FBI. The caveat, in
the form of a computerized "stamp," read:




                                      67

                            B O O K O N E : A T T A C K

   Except for information reflecting a direct threat to life, neither this
   product nor any information contained in this product may be dis-
   seminated to U.S. criminal investigators or prosecutors without
   prior approval of NSA. All subsequent product which contains in-
   formation obtained or derived from this product must bear this ca-
  veat. Contact the Office of General Counsel of NSA for guidance
   concerning this caveat.


  This shifted the burden from the NSA to the FBI. From then on, every-
thing pumped out of the NSA that related to terrorism would contain the
caveat, even though just a minute fraction of the NSA's counterterrorism-
related intercepts came from FISA surveillance.
   For the FBI, the NSA's policy was a nightmare. Before any informa-
tion from an NSA report was passed from the intelligence side to the
criminal side it would first have to be routed back to the NSA and then
approved by the agency's general counsel, a process that could take up to
five days. It was a very onerous task and one that largely fell on the backs
of the bureau's cadre of analysts, the intelligence operations specialists
such as Dina Corsi.
   Unlike the special agents, who traditionally entered the bureau as law-
yers, CPAs, or ex-military, the IOSs came from a wide variety of back-
grounds. Some entered from graduate schools where they had specialized
in area studies or international relations. Others, like Corsi, rose from
within the administrative side of the bureau. Arriving as a clerk in 1988
while attending college, Corsi graduated in 1995 and entered the bureau's
language training program. Emerging as a Russian language specialist,
she worked on foreign counterintelligence issues and then switched to
intelligence work on counterterrorism cases, becoming an IOS in 2000.
Since then she had worked in the bureau's bin Laden unit, focusing pri-
marily on the investigation into the Cole bombing--a bombing in which
they now believed Mihdhar was involved.
  Throughout the summer, Mihdhar continued to be a key focus for
Maggie Gillespie at Alec Station and Dina Corsi at FBI headquarters, and
they often e-mailed each other or met in Washington. On August 7, Corsi
asked Gillespie for a copy of the flight manifest for Mihdhar's January
2000 trip to Malaysia. "I plan to write something up, but perhaps we




                                      68

                                  W A R N I N G

should schedule another sit down to compare notes on both sides," Corsi
wrote. "Let me know." "Okay, all sounds good," replied Gillespie.
   Given the high level of NSA intercepts and bin Laden's warning, by
then the head of the CIA's Counterterrorism Center, Cofer Black, feared
an attack was imminent. On August 15, he concluded a briefing to the
Department of Defense's Annual Convention on Counterterrorism with
the comment, "We are going to be struck soon, many Americans are go-
ing to die, and it could be in the U.S."
  Six days later, on August 21, Gillespie was scanning through CIA ca-
bles at Alec Station when she suddenly stopped. It was the March cable
indicating that Hazmi had flown to the U.S. and entered Los Angeles. It
was a breathtaking moment. Suddenly "it all click[ed] for me," she said.
One of the possible terrorists she had been tracking for months on the
other side of the world might be just on the other side of the continent.
With her adrenaline pumping, Gillespie checked with Customs and dis-
covered that Mihdhar had also entered the U.S.--just weeks before, on
July 4--and had not departed. A pair of suspected terrorists were loose
somewhere in the U.S.

B   ack in Germany, Ramzi Binalshibh followed Atta's instructions. He
   purchased two phones, one with which to keep in touch with Atta
and another to communicate with everyone else. If the NSA picked up
the calls from Binalshibh to the Middle East, Atta believed, they would
not be able to link the number to calls from Binalshibh to Atta. To further
obscure the nature of the communications and frustrate any interception,
the group had worked out a series of code words, and using those terms,
Binalshibh passed on to Khalid Shaikh the highlights of the meeting.
  With everything again on track, the planning shifted into overdrive.
A week after returning from Spain, Atta flew to Newark, where Hazmi
picked him up in his blue Toyota Corolla and took him to the King's
Inn in Wayne, New Jersey, a nondescript, two-story transient way station.
Atta paid $69.90 in advance in cash and checked into Room 230, a few
doors down from Khalid al-Mihdhar. He was there to fill them in on the
meeting with Binalshibh and to coordinate the next few weeks. Ever con-
cerned about the NSA, when he had to make an overseas call, he would
duck into Tony's Hair Stylist or Julian's Hardware and use the pay phone
and an AT&T prepaid calling card.
  By now the teams had chosen their targets, and Hanjour, Hazmi and
his brother Salem, Mihdhar, and Majed Moqed volunteered to attack the
Pentagon, the five-sided heart of America's war machine. A week before,
Hanjour and Hazmi had rented a plane at Caldwell Flight Academy, a few
miles away in Fairfield, New Jersey. On their first surveillance flight over


                                    70

                                  F O R T L E E

the Washington area, they flew down to a suburban airfield in Gaithers-
burg, Maryland, a route that would have allowed them to see from the air
many of the capital's landmarks.
  While Atta decided to hit the North Tower of the World Trade Center
and Marwan al-Shehhi volunteered to crash into the South Tower, there
was still some disagreement over the target for the fourth pilot, Ziad Jar-
rah. In a series of e-mails, Atta and Binalshibh discussed the matter. But
to hide their true meaning from the NSA or any other intelligence agency
that might be intercepting the messages, they used coded language. They
pretended to be students discussing various fields of study: "architecture"
referred to the World Trade Center, "arts" the Pentagon, "law" the Capi-
tol, and "politics" the White House. Once again Binalshibh reminded
Atta that bin Laden wanted to hit the White House.
   And once again Atta cautioned that such an action would be difficult.
But when Binalshibh persisted, Atta agreed to include the White House
but suggested they keep the Capitol Building as an alternate target in case
the White House proved too difficult. Planning for maximum casualties
among senators and members of Congress, Atta also suggested that the
attacks not happen until after the first week in September, when Congress
reconvened.
   For months Binalshibh had been communicating bin Laden's impa-
tience and his desire for a date for the operation, and by mid-August,
Atta was ready to give it to him. Again to defeat any NSA analyst who
might be listening, he used a riddle to convey the date to Binalshibh, a
riddle containing two branches, a slash, and a lollipop. In other words
11/9, the European way of writing 9/11. Just to be sure before he passed
the message on to Khalid Shaikh, who would then pass it on to bin Laden,
Binalshibh called Atta back to confirm the date.
  With the date now set in stone, Atta again flew up to Newark to meet
with Hazmi and begin coordinating the complex task of picking just the
right seats on just the right flights on just the right type of aircraft at just
the right times. He wanted the attacks to happen with maximum explosive
power, in the morning when most people were at work, and as simultane-
ously as possible. Once officials in Washington began to understand what
was happening, Atta knew, they would immediately make every effort to
ground all aircraft. Timing would be everything.
   It was just after ten on a warm and muggy late-summer evening when


                                       71

                             B O O K O N E : A T T A C K

Atta stepped off Spirit Airlines Flight 460 at Newark. The next day, Fri-
day, he briefed Hazmi and Mihdhar on the dates and they discussed flights
and schedules. Then on Saturday, August 25, they were finally ready to
start booking the September 11 flights. In this new type of war in which
cheap motels are used as barracks and commercial jets become power-
ful weapons, public libraries and Internet cafés are quickly transformed
into communications centers. Thus, Mihdhar and Majed Moqed drove
ten minutes from Totowa to William Paterson University, a state school
on 370 wooded acres in Wayne.
   Cutting across the campus, they entered the squat, concrete-block
David and Lorraine Cheng Library, a state-of-the-art building with high
ceilings, colorful abstract art on the wall, and, in the Electronic Resource
Center, a bank of thirty-six computers open to the public free of charge.
Mihdhar logged on to his e-mail account, kkhd20002@yahoo.com, pulled
up Travelocity.com, and began looking for a morning nonstop flight on
American Airlines from Washington's Dulles Airport to Los Angeles on
September 11. The best flight was 77, which departed at 8:10 and used
the same equipment in which they had conducted their surveillance trip.
Mihdhar then logged on to AA.com, the airline's Web page, and booked
two seats in coach, 12A and 12B, using Moqed's Visa card.
   To keep from looking suspicious, the group logged on to the Internet at
computers in a variety of locations around the area. That same afternoon,
Atta went to Yuricom, Inc., a small computer repair shop on Main Street
in Fort Lee, New Jersey, and searched on Travelocity for 8:00 a.m. flights
on September 11 from Boston to Los Angeles and from Dulles to Los
Angeles, both for two people. A few doors down the street was The Web
Station, where the day before Mihdhar had opened an American Airlines
Advantage account, enabling him to book and pay for a flight online.
On Sunday, Atta and Mihdhar were back at the keyboard searching for
flights on Travelocity, this time at Cyber Café on West Main Street in Fort
Lee. Atta made his final decision and purchased two tickets.
   But despite Atta's focus on tight security, that weekend Hazmi may
have telephoned his old friend from San Diego, Mihdhar Zaid, who
helped Hazmi and Mihdhar get settled when they arrived. Beginning
around August 25, according to his friends, Mihdhar Zaid began acting
strangely and he stopped making phone calls from his telephone. Oth-
ers in the group that hung out at Sam's Star Mart, the Texaco gas station

where Mihdhar Zaid and Hazmi worked, may also have received word
that something big would happen soon.
  Later, in October, after Mihdhar Zaid was arrested on immigration
charges, several fellow inmates claimed he bragged that he knew both
Hazmi and Mihdhar were planning a terrorist attack. According to one
inmate, Mihdhar Zaid claimed someone had notified him that Hazmi and
Mihdhar would be arriving in Los Angeles with plans to carry out an at-
tack. Mihdhar Zaid also allegedly said that he had driven the two from
Los Angeles to San Diego. As new information came up years later, the
FBI would begin taking a second look at Mihdhar Zaid, but by then he
had already been deported back to Yemen.
  On Monday, August 27, Hazmi drove Atta to their new staging area in
Laurel, Maryland.

                             Discovery



G   illespie could hardly wait to tell Corsi the news of her discovery, that
    both Mihdhar and Hazmi were somewhere in the U.S. On Wednesday,
August 22, the two met in the FBI's tan, fortresslike headquarters. Corsi
was stunned. She then discovered that Mihdhar and Hazmi had flown into
Los Angeles together on January 15, 2000, listing their destination in the
city as the Sheraton Hotel. A check with the INS revealed that Mihd-
har had departed from Los Angeles on June 10, 2000, aboard Lufthansa
Airlines, but no departure record could be found for Hazmi. Corsi thus
assumed that Hazmi had departed at the same time. But Hazmi had never
left. The data flowed in quickly now. Another INS message indicated that
when Mihdhar reentered the U.S. on July 4, he had come in through New
York and listed his destination as the Marriott Hotel in New York City, the
one at the World Trade Center.
   Later that day, the two rushed over to Wilshire's FBI office and gave
him the news. But it was like a rerun of an old movie. He apparently
made no mention of the fact that he had known most of the details for
a year and a half or more and actively kept the information secret from
the bureau. All agreed that an intelligence investigation to locate Mihd-
har should be started immediately. Back at Alec Station, Gillespie asked
another CIA official to draft a message to the State Department, INS,
Customs, and the FBI requesting the placement of Mihdhar and Hazmi
on U.S. watch lists.
   On August 23, Corsi contacted the State Department to get a copy of


                                     74

Mihdhar's most recent visa application from the U.S. Consulate in Jedda,
Saudi Arabia. Later, after obtaining permission to open an intelligence
investigation into Khalid M. Mihdhar, she called the New York agent on
the bin Laden squad to give him a "heads up" alert that the paperwork
would soon be coming. She was eager for the case to get under way be-
fore Mihdhar left the country. Finally, she called Wilshire and told him
she had found another link in Malaysia between Mihdhar and the Cole
bombing. "I am still looking at intel," she said, "but I think we have more
of a definitive connection to the Cole here than we thought."
   Corsi was also hoping to help the criminal investigators working on
the Cole bombing by getting them details on the highly secret link be-
tween Mihdhar and bin Laden's Yemen ops center. But the only place to
obtain such permission was the NSA, and on Monday, August 27, she
sent over the urgent request.
  That afternoon, Hayden must have been shocked. He had at last dis-
covered that Mihdhar, whose conversations they had been recording for
the past eighteen months, along with his partner, Hazmi, had been living
in the country, on and off, for much of that time. He approved Corsi's
request immediately, and must have known how difficult it would be to
now find them. They could be almost anywhere.
  At that moment, Hayden could have almost seen Atta, Mihdhar, Hazmi,
and the others from his eighth-floor window. That same afternoon, the hi-
jackers were having their penultimate summit meeting at their new base,
the Valencia Motel in Laurel, Maryland, a shabby truck stop just two
miles away from Hayden's office.

I t was the ultimate irony. At long last, the hunter and the hunted were
  now living next door to each other--without either knowing of the oth-
er's presence. For years Laurel had been the agency's "company town."
Since the NSA first moved to the area in the late 1950s, Laurel had served
as its bedroom community. As the agency grew, so did Laurel. It was
where nearly everyone seemed to work simply for "the government," or
"the Department of Defense." Merchants and neighbors understood the
code; whenever they heard the phrase they knew that it meant the NSA
and that they should inquire no further.
   That Monday afternoon, August 27, Ziad Jarrah flew into Baltimore-
Washington International Airport from Fort Lauderdale and joined Atta,
Hazmi and his brother Salem, Hanjour, Moqed, and Mihdhar. It was a ma-
jor operational meeting and the group was spread out among three hotels
in Laurel: the Turf, the Pin-Del, and the Valencia. In the afternoon Hazmi
went to the local Kinko's store in Laurel, logged on to Travelocity, and
purchased his and Salem's tickets for September 11 on American Flight
77 to Los Angeles. Then at about 2:30 he went to the Target store on Fort
Meade Road and purchased a Leatherman Wave folding tool knife. A fat
hunk of stainless steel, it contained two knives, two wire cutters, a saw, a
scissors, and an assortment of other sharp instruments.
   Over the next two weeks, the terrorists and the eavesdroppers would
coexist in the NSA's close-knit community like unseeing ghosts. Together,
they would eat gooey cheese at Pizza Time, pump iron at Gold's Gym,


                                     76

                                   L A U R E L

and squeeze tomatoes at Safeway. For eighteen months, since the agency
first identified Mihdhar and Hazmi as likely al-Qaeda terrorists, NSA
analysts had been listening to their phone calls and reading their e-mail;
now they were in touching distance. Registered under their real names,
they ate, sweated, and banked alongside their pursuers. Like neighbors,
they shopped at J.C. Penney and Wal-Mart, bought groceries at Giant
Foods, dined at the Food Factory, and banked at the First Union National
Bank and the Dime Savings Bank.
   Hazmi's entire team, all five, would consolidate into Room 343 of the
Valencia Motel. A $308-a-week suite, with two beds, a small living room,
and a kitchenette, it was a crossroads for truckers, transients, budget trav-
elers, and welfare recipients placed there by the state. Every morning and
night, thousands of NSA employees would pass Hazmi's blue Toyota Co-
rolla with its California tags, parked in front of his room, as they crawled
in heavy traffic down Route 1, the main drag through town to the NSA.
   Despite the significance of the investigation, an FBI analyst simply
gave the hunt for the suspected terrorists a "routine" precedence, the low-
est of three, and on Thursday, August 30, a novice FBI intelligence agent
transferred to the FBI's bin Laden unit just weeks before was assigned to
it. It was Special Agent Rob Fuller's first intelligence investigation. He
had graduated from the FBI Academy in June 2000 and over the past year
had worked briefly on an applicant squad, a drug squad, and a surveil-
lance squad.
   The day Fuller was assigned the case, Mihdhar, Hazmi, and Hanjour
were back in Totowa closing the lease on their top-floor apartment. Han-
jour picked up their security deposit from owner Jimi Nouri, who never
bothered to check the apartment for damage "because [Hanjour] was a
gentleman," he said. They then lugged out the same two suitcases and
garbage bag stuffed with clothing they brought with them more than
three months before. "They left as quietly as they came in," said neighbor
Giselle Diaz.
   Because Fuller was busy with other cases, he was not able to even pick
up the Mihdhar/Hazmi case folder until Tuesday, September 4, when
he completed a lookout request on Mihdhar for the INS. But instead of
checking off the box on the form indicating he was wanted for "security/
terrorism," and was to be considered "armed and dangerous," he mistak-
enly checked the "witness" box. He also contacted a Customs Service


                                      77

                           B O O K O N E : A T T A C K

representative and verified that they too had a lookout for Mihdhar. He
then requested a local criminal history check on Mihdhar through the
New York City Police Department. Eventually, Fuller also noticed Haz-
mi's name on the investigative order, so he did the same checks on him.
   As the FBI's search began, the hijackers were having a leisurely day
in Laurel. Mihdhar was shopping at The Shoe Department for a pair of
Timberland shoes and several MUDD Ripstop Cargo bags; Hazmi was
nearby buying an ID bracelet at the Gold Valley jewelry store; and Han-
jour was at the local DMV office getting a new Maryland ID with the ad-
dress 14625 Baltimore Avenue in Laurel, the location of the group's mail
drop. Later, Mihdhar, Hanjour, and Salem al-Hazmi went for a workout
at Gold's Gym.
   On Wednesday, Fuller requested a criminal history check and a search
of motor vehicle records for any information on Mihdhar and Hazmi. He
then contacted the Marriott hotels in the New York area since Mihdhar
had listed on his customs form that his destination was the New York
Marriott at the World Trade Center. But the six Marriotts he contacted
all said Mihdhar had never registered as a guest. Fuller then conducted a
Choicepoint search, which checks a variety of public records, but turned
up nothing. At 10:17 a.m., Mihdhar and Moqed were at the American
Airlines ticket counter at Baltimore-Washington International Airport.
Counting out hundred-dollar bills, they were paying $2,300 for their tick-
ets on Flight 77 on September 11 from Dulles to Los Angeles.
   By Friday, September 7, every check had thus far turned up zero. That
day, Atta sold his 1986 Pontiac Grand Prix to Sun Auto Leasing in Fort
Lauderdale for $800 and then again flew up to Baltimore-Washington
International Airport for a final coordination conference with Hazmi in
Laurel. One of the key details was to close out all remaining bank ac-
counts and send the remaining money back to bin Laden's bankers in the
UAE. On Saturday, Hazmi, Mihdhar, and Hanjour emptied their accounts
and gave the cash to Atta. Then, while many NSA employees were do-
ing their weekly grocery shopping, he went to the Giant store in Laurel
and, via Western Union, wired $5,000 to the Wall Street Exchange Cen-
ter in Dubai. He then went to a nearby Safeway and wired an additional
$2,860.
   For the meeting, Ziad Jarrah had driven down to Laurel from the Mar-
riott Hotel at Newark International Airport, the staging area for his flight


                                     78

                                  L A U R E L

into the White House. That night they went to dinner at their favorite
restaurant, the Food Factory, an inexpensive eatery specializing in kebabs
and Afghan and Pakistani cuisine. With the twangy sounds of the sitar
and the rhythmic beat of the tabla playing in the background, Mihdhar
paid the $54.82 tab. It was past eleven when Jarrah left the Valencia and
headed back to Newark. In a hurry after the long day, he leaned heavily
on the accelerator as he sped through Maryland on Route 95. Then a few
minutes past midnight, just across the Susquehanna River Bridge in the
small town of Port Deposit, Jarrah saw a red light flashing in his rearview
mirror and he pulled over. After everything, he must have thought, on the
eve of the mission, trouble.
   Stepping out of his patrol car, Maryland state trooper Joseph Catalano
walked up to the passenger window of Jarrah's red Mitsubishi Galant.
"How are you doing today?" he asked and then brusquely told him he
was clocked at ninety in a sixty-five-mile-per-hour zone. "Can I see
your license and registration, please?" He then checked Jarrah's Virginia
driver's license, which gave a phony address, 6601 Quicksilver Drive,
Springfield, Virginia. It was a parking lot near the Springfield Mall. "You
still live in Springfield, on Quicksilver Drive?" Jarrah calmly said, "Yes."
A few minutes later, after checking that the car was not stolen, Catalano
returned to the passenger window and handed Jarrah a ticket. "Okay, sir,
ninety miles an hour in a sixty-five zone is a two-hundred-seventy-
dollar fine. I need your signature down here at the bottom," he said. "You
are free to go." Jarrah said nothing, turned on his left-hand blinker, and
pulled back into traffic. Seven minutes after it began, the last opportunity
to stop the plot was over. Catalano would later say that Jarrah was ex-
tremely calm and cooperative throughout the stop.
   On Sunday, Atta flew to Boston as the four teams consolidated at their
staging areas. Hanjour's Pentagon crew was in Laurel, and Jarrah's White
House team was in Newark. But because both Twin Tower attacks were
to originate from Boston's Logan International Airport, Atta was likely
worried about the image of ten Arabs, most of whom spoke little English,
suddenly showing up at the same time at Logan for two flights. He there-
fore searched for the closest airport to Boston with a flight early enough
to connect to American Flight 11, which was due to depart Logan for Los
Angeles at 7:45 a.m. What he came up with was Portland, Maine. Thus,
instead of leaving from Boston, on Monday he and Abdulaziz al-Omari


                                     79

would drive to Portland and catch U.S. Airways Flight 5930, operated by
Colgan Air, departing for Boston at 6:00 a.m. Tuesday.
   After Atta left Laurel, Hazmi and Mihdhar began planning a final cel-
ebratory meal for their crew. Hazmi went to the Giant supermarket in
Laurel and bought $158.14 worth of groceries, and Mihdhar went back
later for another $57.60. That night at the Valencia, behind the door to
Room 343, the five men cooked over a small stove and ate in the crowded
kitchenette. For all, like the other members of the cabal, it was the end of
their journey, a journey from different places over different roads but with
the same final destination.
   Early Monday morning, Mihdhar, Hazmi, and the others loaded up
their beat-up Toyota Corolla as a conga line of NSA employees, heading
in to work, passed slowly by a few feet away on Route 1. By then, the
agency's secret city was already buzzing. At 7:15 a.m. Hayden, swivel-
ing in his high-back, padded maroon chair, focused his attention on one
of the two television sets in his office. It was time for his private intel-
ligence briefing, broadcast from the agency's war-room-like National
Security Operations Center. On this day, the topic was suicide bombers;
Ahmed Shah Massoud, forty-eight, a key rebel leader fighting the Taliban
in Afghanistan, had been assassinated. The chief suspect was Osama bin
Laden.
   Following the televised briefing, Hayden convened his "Breakfast
Club," as he called it. "A stand-up meeting in here with just my personal
staff," Hayden said, "public affairs, inspector general, lawyers, each of
the key components represented. It's real quick. Literally a stand-up, ev-
eryone's standing, including me. The room is about a third full. We'll go
quickly around--hot news of the day." By Monday, few items were hotter
than bin Laden. The previous week, the FBI had notified him that Mih-
dhar and Hazmi were loose somewhere in the country, and now bin Laden
and the Taliban appeared to be launching a new war in Afghanistan.
   Later that day, two intercepts were received that may have referred
to the attack either on Massoud or on America. One said, "Tomorrow is
zero hour," and the other said, "The match begins tomorrow." They were
between targeted pay phones in a highly dangerous area of Afghanistan
and people in Saudi Arabia. But despite the importance of their points of
origin, they sat unread throughout the day.
   At the time, Mihdhar and Hazmi were a few miles down the road,


                                       80

                                  L A U R E L

checking out of Room 343 at the Valencia Motel. In a series of deposits
to his First Union National Bank account that morning, Mihdhar depos-
ited nearly $10,000 in cash and traveler's checks. They then went to Mail
Boxes, Etc. in Laurel, where Hazmi mailed a package addressed to their
financial contact in Dubai. Among the items inside was a handwritten
letter in Arabic from Mihdhar to his wife in which he expressed his deep
love for her and their daughter and his desire for her to have the money in
the account. His bank card and PIN were included with the letter.
   Hazmi may also have called his old friends back at the Sam's Star Mart
Texaco station to give them a heads up about the attack. Early on Monday
morning, Mihdhar Zaid and a number of others began behaving suspi-
ciously. One allegedly said, "It is finally going to happen," as the others
celebrated by giving each other high fives.
   While Hazmi and his crew were in Laurel tying up loose ends, FBI spe-
cial agent Rob Fuller was hoping to find the two in Los Angeles, where
they had first landed a year and a half earlier, claiming to stay at the
Sheraton Hotel. Fuller drafted a memo for the FBI's Los Angeles field of-
fice asking them to begin a search of Sheraton Hotel records concerning
any stays by Mihdhar and Hazmi in early 2000. He also requested that the
Los Angeles office check United Airlines and Lufthansa Airlines records
for any payment or other information concerning Mihdhar and Hazmi.
   At three o'clock, Hazmi checked the group into Room 122 at the Mar-
riott Residence Inn at 315 Elden Street in Herndon, Virginia, where they
would spend their last night. The hotel had two advantages; it was a short
drive to the airport and it contained a Gold's Gym.

                              Surprise



T  he clock radio went off at 5:45 a.m., an hour before sunrise. "Defense
   secretary Donald Rumsfeld says he can trim a billion dollars or more
in Pentagon operating costs by reducing waste and inefficiency." Host
Bob Edwards was introducing a story about military spending on Na-
tional Public Radio's popular Morning Edition program. "In a speech
yesterday, Rumsfeld told Defense Department workers that he's declaring
war on bureaucracy." As he usually did, Mike Hayden lay in bed, eyes
closed in the darkness, until after the six o'clock news summary. It was
Tuesday, September 11, and the Pentagon had just declared war on itself.
"Some might ask how in the world could the secretary of defense attack
the Pentagon in front of its people," Rumsfeld asked rhetorically. "To
them I reply, `I have no desire to attack the Pentagon.' "




But at 6:22 a.m., as they checked out of the Marriott Residence Inn in
Herndon, that was exactly what Hazmi and his crew had in mind that
day. A few minutes later he climbed behind the wheel of his Toyota Co-
rolla one last time for the short drive to Dulles International Airport. Like
Hazmi, who was wearing a neatly pressed blue oxford shirt and tan khaki
pants, the crew all dressed casually but conservatively. With no mustaches
or beards and their hair neatly trimmed, they might have been going to a
Rotary Club meeting.


                                      82

                                S U R P R I S E

   Arriving at the Dulles parking garage, the team separated into groups
of no more than two and entered the American Airlines ticket area, where
Mihdhar and Hazmi faced their final security hurdle. Having evaded the
CIA, NSA, FBI, INS, State Department, and assorted other intelligence
and security organizations for close to two years, now they just needed to
get through airport security and they were free to carry out their deadly
mission. At 7:15, Mihdhar and Majed Moqed presented their Virginia
ID cards, fraudulently arranged in the parking lot of a 7-Eleven, to the
American Airlines ticket agent at the check-in counter.
   By now, with numerous domestic flights behind them, including dress
rehearsal practice missions, they knew how the system worked--as well
as where it didn't. At the time, the principal tool to screen for poten-
tial terrorists was a program known as the computer-assisted passen-
ger prescreening system (CAPPS). Used by all airlines, the program
was designed to identify the most questionable passengers--those who
purchased their tickets with cash, for example, or purchased one-way
tickets.
   Once selected by the computer, a passenger's checked baggage would
be screened for explosives and held off the plane until the passenger
boarded. The procedure was to avoid the problem of passengers check-
ing luggage containing explosives and then not boarding the plane. If
a person boarded the plane, the theory went, the odds are they would
not have a bomb in their bag. However, neither those selected nor their
carry-on luggage would be subject to additional scrutiny in the security
checkpoint area. The program also contained the names of potential ter-
rorists, who would be flagged at the counter, denied a ticket, and pos-
sibly arrested.
   Both Mihdhar and Moqed were flagged by CAPPS, but since Mihdhar
had no checked luggage and Moqed wasn't carrying any explosives, the
procedures had no effect on their mission. Also, at the time, there were
only twenty names of potential terrorists in the computer database--none
belonging to any of the nineteen hijackers.
  Within the next twenty minutes the Hazmi brothers and Hanjour
would also check in. Hanjour, arriving at the counter by himself, was also
flagged by CAPPS, and the Hazmi brothers were flagged by the Ameri-
can Airlines ticket agent because one of them had no photo identification
and could not understand English, and because the agent found both to be


                                     83

                            B O O K O N E : A T T A C K

suspicious. But, again, because Hanjour had only carry-on luggage, and
no one was carrying any explosives anyway, the selection process proved
useless. Ahead lay the final barrier: the security screening checkpoint.




After a quick shower, Mike Hayden climbed into his Volvo and drove the
three miles across Fort Meade to the NSA's Ops 2B building, arriving
about 6:50. With only one vehicle in the family, his wife or son would
often drop him off and then keep the car. Entering the lobby, he slipped
his blue security badge into the CONFIRM card reader, pushed through
the turnstile, and turned the key in the lock of his private elevator. On the
eighth floor he walked past a receptionist and walls lined with large framed
pictures of antenna-covered listening posts, then took a left through an
unmarked wooden door and entered his spacious corner office.
  Taking a seat in his maroon leather chair, Hayden was surrounded by
the accoutrements of power, knickknacks and souvenirs of a long air force
career. On his walnut desk was a penholder from his days as the number
two commander in Korea, a notepad printed with the word        DIRECTOR , and
a Brookstone world clock. On a table behind him, next to his NSA flag,
sat two computers, one for classified and the other for unclassified work.
The table also contained a series of telephones. One was for internal calls;
another, the STU-III, was used for secure, highly secret external calls;
a black "executive phone" connected him to other senior officials; and
a white phone could put him through instantly to Secretary of Defense
Rumsfeld and the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. No phones, how-
ever, connected him directly to the White House.
  At about 7:15 Hayden began looking over his schedule for the day--a
schedule he knew would be made more complicated by Rumsfeld's dec-
laration of war on Pentagon bureaucracy. There would be calls for more
cuts to his already depleted budget, reduced by 32 percent over the past
decade.




Three minutes later, Mihdhar and Moqed entered Dulles Airport's west
security screening checkpoint, where they placed their carry-on bags on

the belt of the X-ray machine and proceeded through the arched magne-
tometer. Both set off the alarm, and they were directed to a second metal
detector. Mihdhar did not trigger the alarm and was permitted through
the checkpoint. After Moqed set it off, a screener quickly passed a wand
around him and he was allowed to pass.
   At 7:35, Hani Hanjour placed two carry-on bags on the belt and pro-
ceeded, without alarm, through the magnetometer. A short time later,
Nawaf and Salem al-Hazmi entered the same checkpoint. Salem cleared
the metal detector and was permitted through, but Nawaf set off the alarms
for both the first and the second metal detectors. In his pocket or in his
hand luggage he had the heavy Leatherman multitool utility knife he had
purchased at the Laurel Target store. But at the time, as they knew from
their test flights, such a knife was permitted to be carried on board as long
as the blade was less than four inches. A screener waved a wand over
Nawaf and, as with Moqed, let him go without ever bothering to check
what set off the alarm. A minute later another screener swiped Nawaf's
over-the-shoulder carry-on bag with an explosive trace detector, producing
negative results. The last security barrier had been successfully breached.
   The drab waiting area for American Flight 77 to Los Angeles was un-
crowded; Tuesdays were generally among the slowest flying days of the
week. At 7:50 Mihdhar walked down the Jetway with a black bag slung
over his shoulder, wheeling a black carry-on behind him. He and Moqed
entered the fuselage of the silver Boeing 757-223 and took seats 12A and
12B in coach, with Mihdhar in the center and Moqed at the window. In
their section of the plane the flight was barely a quarter full, with just 43
of the 154 seats occupied.
   A few minutes after Mihdhar, Hanjour walked on with a black bag draped
over the shoulder of his white shirt and another, larger one in his hand. A
flight attendant directed him to the left into first class and he took seat 1B,
on the aisle directly in front of the cockpit door. The Hazmi brothers fol-
lowed and took seats 5E and 5F on the right side of the first-class cabin,
and at 8:16, the wide-body jet began to taxi away from the terminal.




At 8:00, as he did every Tuesday and Thursday, Mike Hayden took the
elevator down to the third floor and walked across to the National Secu-

rity Operations Center in Ops 1 for his regular morning meeting with his
senior staff. "It's something I started here because I wanted the seniors
to get a sense of the ops tempo," he said. Among the more worrisome
items the ops officer brought up that morning was the assassination of
Massoud. The action seemed to have touched off a new offensive by the
Taliban against Massoud's Northern Alliance forces. Also, although the
White House was cautiously avoiding discussing whether Massoud was
dead because of some conflicting reports from his group, intelligence
reports were indicating that Massoud had died on a helicopter en route to
Dushanbe, the capital of neighboring Tajikistan.
   Then there was the usual assortment of other items--in the Middle
East, Israeli tanks ringing the West Bank city of Jenin began shelling Pal-
estinian security positions just outside town; in Istanbul, Turkey, a female
suicide bomber killed two police officers and injured at least twenty other
people. About seven minutes after the briefing began it was over. "I keep
beating them to keep it shorter," Hayden said. Following the ops briefing,
the group moved into the small conference room next door for a quick
staff meeting. "By eight or eight thirty we've kind of gotten the burst
communications and now you're into your work schedule."




"American 77, Dulles tower," said the controller. "Runway three zero, taxi
into position and hold. You'll be holding for landing traffic one left and
for wake turbulence spacing behind the DC-10." Seated in the front row,
Hanjour kept his eyes focused on the cockpit door. As soon as it opened--
when the flight attendants brought the flight crew their breakfast, or one
of the crewmembers left to use a rest room--it would be time to make
their move.
   At 8:20, American Airlines Flight 77 nosed upward into a cloudless,
Tiffany-blue sky.




Following the ops briefing, Hayden returned to his office for a meeting
with a small number of senior officials. A few minutes after it began,
about 8:48, he was standing a few feet from his desk, behind a tall wooden


                                       86

speaker's table, when his executive assistant, Cindy Farkus, walked in. A
plane had just crashed into the World Trade Center, she said. "The imme-
diate image I had was a light plane, off course, bad flying," said Hayden,
who glanced at CNN just as they began showing scenes from Mohamed
Atta's attack on the North Tower. "I thought that was a big fire for a small
plane," he said, and then continued with his meeting.




At about that same moment aboard Flight 77, Hazmi and his crew sprang
into action. They had trained the scenario many times: they would pull
out their knives and box cutters and take command of the aircraft, order-
ing the crew to relinquish their aircraft, leave it on autopilot, and move to
the back of the plane with the passengers. Then as Hazmi, Mihdhar, and
the rest cleared out the cockpit, first class, and the front of coach, Hanjour
would walk into the cockpit with the case he brought onboard containing
maps, charts, and flying aids.
   The entire operation appears to have worked like clockwork. At 8:50:48,
Indianapolis Control transmitted the navigation message "American 77
cleared direct um Falmouth," and the crew responded three seconds later,
"uh direct Falmouth American 77 thank you." Less than four minutes later,
at 8:54, Hanjour was at the controls as the plane made its first deviation
from its assigned course by turning slightly to the south. And two min-
utes later the transponder was switched off, causing the aircraft to disap-
pear from primary radar.
   With the transponder switched off, the plane had become virtually in-
visible to the controller on the ground who had been tracking the flight.
Desperate to find it, he began searching along its projected flight path
and the airspace to the southwest where it had started to turn. But there
was nothing there. He tried the radios, calling the aircraft directly, then
the airline. Again there was nothing. Indianapolis Control then made the
first of ten unsuccessful attempts over the next six and a half minutes to
contact the aircraft via radio. Finally, shortly after 8:56, the controllers
agreed to "sterilize the air space" along the flight's projected westerly
route so that other planes would not be affected by Flight 77.
   By 9:00 a.m., Hanjour had turned to the east and had begun to descend.
Five minutes later the plane's blip again appeared on the radar scopes of


                                       87

                           B O O K O N E : A T T A C K

Indianapolis Control, but well east of where it should have been, leading
to great confusion, including thoughts that the plane might already have
crashed. After another seven minutes, Hanjour leveled off at twenty-five
thousand feet and made a slight course change to the east-northeast. "You
guys never been able to raise him at all?" asked a radar operator at In-
dianapolis Control. "No," said the air traffic controller. "We called [the]
company. They can't even get ahold of him, so there's no, no, uh, no radio
communications and no radar."

C  indy Farkus again broke into Hayden's meeting, but this time she
   was almost running. Another plane had hit the second tower, she said.
"One plane's an accident, two planes is an attack," said Hayden, who im-
mediately adjourned his meeting and asked Farkus to quickly summon
the agency's top security officials to his office. L. Kemp Ensor, the Na-
tional Security Agency's associate director for security, walked into the
director's office with his assistants. "As they were walking through the
door, I knew exactly what we needed to do and I said, `All nonessential
personnel out of here.' Out of the complex," said Hayden.
  Throughout the NSA, loudspeakers began sounding. "All nonessential
personnel are to leave the building," came the announcement over and
over.




Within Alec Station, CIA officers and FBI agents stared at the television
in disbelief. "I saw the second plane hit in the office and it was like, oh
my God, we're under attack," said FBI agent Mark Rossini. "No one ut-
tered it. We just knew, we just knew. It was just frantic. Then we were just
trying to find information--trying to find everything we could that's on
cable traffic, what's being written. In some respects, we had no idea what
was going on--we couldn't really do anything. Everybody immediately
suspected it was bin Laden."

Shortly after nine, Theodore Olson, the Bush administration's solicitor
general, heard about the hijackings and quickly turned on his office tele-
vision. His wife, Barbara Olson, forty-five, a talk-show regular, was fly-
ing to Los Angeles that morning, and he was worried that she might have
been on one of the planes that crashed into the World Trade Center. A
fixture on cable networks for her strident advocacy of conservative and
far-right issues, Olson was on Flight 77 in seat 3E, a few seats behind and
across from Hanjour.
  After a brief mental calculation, Ted Olson figured his wife's plane
could not have gotten to New York that quickly. Suddenly, a secretary
rushed in. "Barbara is on the phone," she said. Olson jumped for the
receiver. "Our plane has been hijacked!" she said quickly, but after a few
seconds the phone went dead. Olson immediately called the command
center at Justice and alerted them to the fact that there was yet another
hijacked plane--and that his wife was on it. He also said she was able to
communicate, though her first call had been cut off.
   Minutes later, Barbara called back. Speaking very quietly, she said
the hijackers did not know she was making this call. All the passengers,
she said, had been herded to the back by men who had used knives and
box cutters to hijack the plane. The pilot, she said, had announced that
the plane had been hijacked shortly after takeoff. Ted Olson then told
her about the two other planes that had been hijacked that morning and
flown into the World Trade Center. "I think she must have been partially
in shock from the fact that she was on a hijacked plane," Olson recalled.
"She absorbed the information."
  "What shall I tell the pilot? What can I tell the pilot to do?" Barbara
said, trying to remain calm. Ted asked if she could tell where the plane
was at that moment. She said she could see houses and, after asking
someone, said she thought the plane was heading northeast. Then they
reassured each other that the plane was still up in the air, still flying, and
that it would come out all right. "It's going to come out okay," Olson told
his wife, who agreed.
   But Ted Olson knew the situation was anything but all right. "I was
pretty sure everything was not going to be okay," he recalled. "I, by this


                                      90

                                  P E N T A G O N

time, had made the calculation that these were suicide persons, bent on
destroying as much of America as they could." "I love you," she said as
they exchanged feelings for each other. Then the phone suddenly went
dead again. While waiting for another call, Olson remained glued to the
television. It was now about 9:30.




At 9:24, the FAA had alerted officials at NORAD about the missing plane.
Officials there immediately sent out a scramble order to their Air National
Guard unit at Langley Air Force Base in Hampton, Virginia. At 129 miles
away, it was the closest alert base to Washington. As Langley's scramble
horn blared and the battle stations light turned yellow, Major Dean Eck-
mann, a Northwest Airlines pilot serving his regular National Guard rota-
tion, ran for his fighter. Joining him were Major Brad Derrig and Captain
Craig Borgstrom. Six minutes later, NORAD's three F-16s, each loaded
with six missiles, were wheels up. The mission for Eckmann and his two
fellow pilots was to somehow find Flight 77 before it found its target,
and possibly shoot it down. But that would require the authorization of
the president, then in an elementary school in Sarasota, Florida. "I don't
think any fighter pilot in the United States would have ever thought they
would be flying combat air patrols over American cities," Eckmann said.
"That was huge, huge culture shock."




At 9:29, with the plane thirty-eight miles west of the Pentagon and flying
at seven thousand feet, Hanjour turned off the autopilot and took control
of the stick. At that same moment, Dulles tower air traffic control op-
erator Danielle O'Brien spotted an unidentified blip on her radar screen.
Although she didn't know it at the time, it was the missing Flight 77.
   The alarmed controllers quickly called to warn their colleagues at Rea-
gan National Airport, which was located close to downtown Washington.
"Fast-moving primary target," they said, indicating that a plane without
a transponder was heading their way. Tom Howell, the controller next
to O'Brien, glanced over at her screen and his eyes grew wide. "Oh my
God!" he yelled. "It looks like he's headed to the White House! We've


                                       91

                            B O O K O N E : A T T A C K

got a target headed right for the White House!" At full throttle, Ameri-
can Flight 77 was traveling at about five hundred miles per hour directly
toward P-56, the prohibited airspace surrounding the White House and
the Capitol. Because of its speed and the way it maneuvered and turned,
everyone in the radar room of Dulles Airport's tower assumed it was a
military jet.




At the NSA, the one group Hayden could not move to Ops 1 was the
counterterrorism unit, eight floors up on the top of Ops 2B. He visited
the unit and described the employees working there as "emotionally shat-
tered." "One of the more emotional parts of the day, for me," said Hayden.
"I went into our CT [counterterrorism] shop and our logistics folks were
tacking up blackout curtains because we can't move the CT shop in the
midst of this." Hayden called his wife, Jeanine, at their home a few miles
away and asked her to locate their children.
   Hayden then ordered the counterterrorism unit to focus their atten-
tion on Middle Eastern intercepts and to translate and analyze them im-
mediately as they were received, rather than starting with the oldest in
the stack first, as was normally the case. It was then that analysts finally
translated the two messages sent the day before, between pay phones in
a highly dangerous area of Afghanistan and people in Saudi Arabia. To
their shock, one said, "Tomorrow is zero hour," and the other said, "The
match begins tomorrow." Whether they were referring to the attack or to
something else, such as the assassination of Massoud, was unknown; the
messages were too brief and vague. Still, the NSA would wait until the
next day, September 12, before distributing the information to anyone
else in Washington.




Within the tower at Dulles Airport, the tension rippling through the air
was almost visible. The supervisor in the radar room began a countdown
as the unknown plane got closer and closer to the White House. "He's
twelve miles west," he said. "He's moving very fast eastbound--okay,
guys, where is he now? . . . Eleven miles west, ten miles west, nine miles


                                      92

                                  P E N T A G O N

west." About that point, he picked up the phone to the Secret Service
office at the White House. "We have an unidentified, very fast-moving
aircraft inbound toward your vicinity," he said, counting down the miles.
"Eight miles west. Seven miles west."




Many within Alec Station believed the CIA might be the target of Flight
77--a similar scenerio had once been planned by Ramzi Yousef, the man
who bombed the World Trade Center in 1993. "We thought it was coming
for the CIA," said FBI agent Mark Rossini. "So they evacuated the build-
ing, but we stayed. We were in the basement; I thought we'd be okay. We
were in NHB [New Headquarters Building]. It was all underground up to
the fourth floor, so I thought if the plane comes in it's not really going to
hit us, it's going to hit the ground. Or it's going to hit OHB [Old Head-
quarters Building]; it's not really going to hit us. So we all stayed."




At the White House the warning came into the tightly packed Situation
Room, down a flight of stairs from the Oval Office, where three watch of-
ficers continuously monitor computers carrying reports from the various
intelligence agencies. A rush of fear suddenly washed over Franklin C.
Miller, the director for defense policy. The White House could be going
down, he thought. Then he had an aide send out an e-mail with the names
of those present "so that when and if we died, someone would know who
was in there," he said.
   Secret Service officers quickly rushed into Vice President Dick Cheney's
office. "We have to move," said one agent. "We're moving now, sir; we're
moving." Once out, they hustled him down to the Presidential Emergency
Operations Center, a special tubelike bunker under the East Wing of the
building. The rest of the White House staff were told to get out and away
from the building as quickly as possible. "Get out, get out, this is real,"
shouted members of the bomb squad running through the building. "All
the way to H Street, please," one uniformed Secret Service officer yelled.
"Women, drop your heels and run, drop your heels and run," yelled one
Secret Service agent. "Suddenly, the gates that never open except for au-


                                       93

                            B O O K O N E : A T T A C K

thorized vehicles just opened and the whole White House just flooded out,"
recalled Press Secretary Jennifer Millerwise.




At 9:34, with the plane five miles west-southwest of the Pentagon, Han-
jour began a complex, 330-degree right turn.
  "Six miles," said the supervisor. "Five miles, four miles." He was just
about to say three miles when the plane suddenly turned away. "In the
room, it was almost a sense of relief," recalled air traffic controller Dani-
elle O'Brien. "This must be a fighter. This must be one of our guys sent
in, scrambled to patrol our capital and to protect our president, and we
sat back in our chairs and breathed for just a second. In the meantime, all
the rest of the planes are still flying and we're taking care of everything
else."
   Then at about two thousand feet and four miles southwest of the
building, Hanjour pointed the nose down and increased to near maxi-
mum speed. "He's turning back in!" O'Brien yelled. "He's turning back
eastbound!" O'Brien's fellow traffic controller Tom Howell also saw the
turn and began to yell to the supervisor. "Oh my God, John, he's com-
ing back!" Arlington, Virginia, police officer Richard Cox could hardly
believe his eyes. He grabbed for his microphone and called dispatch. "It's
an American Airlines plane, headed east down over the pike, possibly
toward the Pentagon," he said excitedly.
   Traveling at 530 miles per hour and with 36,200 pounds of jet fuel
aboard, Flight 77 smashed into the gray concrete wall of the Pentagon.
The jet hit with such force that it penetrated four of the five concentric
rings of corridors and offices surrounding a gazebo in the center court,
long nicknamed Ground Zero.
  "We lost radar contact with that aircraft," recalled O'Brien. "And we
waited. And we waited. And your heart is just beating out of your chest
waiting to hear what's happened."
  "Dulles, hold all of our inbound traffic," said a voice. "The Pentagon's
been hit." "I remember some folks gasping," recalled O'Brien. "I think I
remember a couple of expletives." "It's just like a big pit in your stomach
because you weren't able to do anything about it to stop it," said Tom
Howell. "That's what I think hurt the most."

                                 P E N T A G O N

   At the Justice Department, Ted Olson heard on the television that an
explosion had taken place at the Pentagon. Although no one identified
the aircraft involved, he knew it was Flight 77, carrying his wife. "I did
and I didn't want to," he recalled. "But I knew."




The NSA, made up of more than fifty buildings containing more than
seven million square feet of space, was an easy place to hit. Following
definite word that the Pentagon had been struck and that there were still
one or more hijacked aircraft headed toward Washington, Hayden or-
dered the three to four thousand remaining essential personnel to imme-
diately leave the agency's three tall towers. They were to relocate to the
three-story Ops 1 building, the old low-rise A-shaped structure that was
the agency's first home in Fort Meade. All four buildings were intercon-
nected, so employees never had to go outside.
   In Ops 1, Hayden and his top staff marched through the automatic
glass doors of the third-floor National Security Operations Center, the
agency's "war room." Normally quiet and sedate, the NSOC suddenly
became a beehive of activity, with watch officers and signals intelligence
officials fielding messages to and from the worldwide listening posts
searching for answers in the dim light. All were watching for a CRITIC
(Critical Intelligence) message--which took highest precedence--warn-
ing of where the next attack might come.
   At 9:53 a.m., less than fifteen minutes after Flight 77 hit the Pentagon,
analysts picked up a phone call from a bin Laden operative in Afghani-
stan to a phone number in the former Soviet republic of Georgia. The per-
son in Afghanistan said that he had "heard good news," and indicated that
a fourth target was yet to be hit--a possible reference to United Flight
93 that would crash in Pennsylvania before reaching its intended target
in Washington.
  "I got in touch with George Tenet," said Hayden. "He said, `What do
you have?' and I passed on whatever information we had." Hayden then
called his wife back, said he was okay, and found out that his children had
been located and were safe.
   Over the next hours and days, it would become clear to Hayden that
the men who attacked America lived, planned, and communicated not


                                      95

                            B O O K O N E : A T T A C K

only within the country but even within the NSA's own community. It
would also become clear to him that the pressures would be enormous to
begin turning the NSA's massive ears inward, and to start filling its near
bottomless data storage capacity with the words and voices of millions of
Americans. For years, under his leadership, the agency had deliberately
taken an overly cautious approach to eavesdropping and, possibly as a
result, contributed to the intelligence failures that led to the attacks. Now
he had a different priority. "Number one, security," he said. "We've got
to defend ourselves."

F  ive miles north of the Pentagon, on a bridge crossing the Potomac
   from Maryland into Virginia, John Poindexter was on his way to work
in Arlington at the moment Hani Hanjour drove Flight 77 into the build-
ing. On his finger was a large ring from the Naval Academy, where he
graduated at the top of his class in 1958, and on his sleeves were cuff
links with the White House seal. A retired rear admiral and former Rea-
gan national security advisor, he had become deeply involved in the arms-
for-hostages scandal, where money from covert arms sales to Iran was
siphoned off to illegally support counterinsurgents in Nicaragua. After
disappearing from public life, he began turning his attention away from
waging wars with guns and guerrillas and toward a new form of warfare,
one that would instead use complex mathematical algorithms and com-
puter-based pattern recognition techniques to defeat an enemy, focusing
on the new emerging threat of terrorism. The idea was to find the enemy
before he could find us.
   Moments after the plane hit the Pentagon, Poindexter received an ur-
gent call on his cell phone from his wife, Linda, who told him about the
attack. "Mark is okay," she said, referring to their son, who was a com-
mander on the staff of the navy's chief of naval operations. "He wasn't in
the building." Poindexter's first thought was relief. Then he began seeing
connections to the type of work he had been doing. "I realized this was a
well-coordinated attack of the type that we had been working to prevent,"
he said.


                                     99

                             B O O K T W O : T A R G E T S

  The more he heard on the radio, about terrorists seizing aircraft and us-
ing them as weapons of mass destruction, the more he became convinced
that his work was the answer to similar attacks in the future. In the Cold
War, indications of pending attacks came via advanced radar systems--
on land, on sea, and in the air--designed to detect incoming aircraft and
missiles, or satellites that could discover their imminent launch. But the
new terrorists turn everyday items into weapons, from cars and trucks
to dinghies and jumbo jets. By the time they have struck, it is too late to
detect them. What was needed was a way to find them at the earliest pos-
sible moment; what was needed were the ideas and techniques he and his
colleagues at Syntek Technologies had been working on for years.
  Arriving at work in time to witness the South Tower collapse on tele-
vision, Poindexter became frustrated and discouraged. Despite six years
of hard effort, they had not been able to convince the intelligence com-
munity of the need to adopt their ideas and concepts. As most of the staff
departed early for home, Poindexter, the company's senior vice president,
remained behind, thinking of how in a matter of hours the world had sud-
denly changed. "I stayed most of the day," he said, "thinking about what
needed to be done."
   Schooled at Annapolis and trained as a scientist, sixty-five-year-old John
Poindexter was a man with a great understanding of schematic diagrams,
wiring charts, and military order. Tall and bulky with a hairless scalp, a
bushy white mustache, and a fondness for pipes, starched white shirts, and
dull gray suits, he was the technocrat's technocrat. The answer to all things
could be found in a test tube, a circuit board, or a mainframe. Thus Poin-
dexter was convinced the answer to the complex problem of Middle East-
ern terrorism was simply to place the everyday actions, public and private,
of all Americans under a massive government magnifying glass.
   Early on September 12 he contacted J. Brian Sharkey, an old friend
who had previously worked for the Pentagon's cutting-edge laboratory,
the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA). In 1999, as
the deputy director of DARPA's Information Systems Office, Sharkey
had introduced a program dubbed Total Information Awareness (TIA), a
name George Orwell would have liked. Eventually TIA died on the vine
and Sharkey left DARPA to become a vice president at SAIC, the giant
defense contracting firm. But now, with America in the grip of fear, TIA's
time had finally come.

   Poindexter and Sharkey held a meeting in a parked car off a Maryland
highway. Both were energized by the idea of turning information into a
weapon, of vacuuming up everyone's digital trail, their parking receipts
and Web searches, their bookstore visits and their gas station fill-ups,
and then using supercomputers and complex algorithms to discover who
among us is a terrorist. The data collected would be from public, private,
and government databases, from Web browsers such as Google, from
credit agencies and credit card companies, and from the Social Security
Administration. Every bit had a history and every keystroke told a story.
Known as data mining, it was automated surveillance on steroids.
   On October 15, at a local Arlington fish restaurant--Gaffney's Restau-
rant, Oyster & Ale House--Sharkey outlined TIA to DARPA's new direc-
tor, Dr. Anthony Tether. By the time the oyster shells were empty, Tether
wholeheartedly endorsed the idea and then suggested that Sharkey run
the operation. Unwilling to give up his very lucrative defense contracting
salary at SAIC, Sharkey instead thought of Poindexter. A few days later,
while the two were sailing on the Chesapeake aboard Poindexter's forty-
two-foot sloop Bluebird, Sharkey suggested to his friend that he talk with
Tether about taking the job. Poindexter liked the idea and a meeting with
Tether was set up. For the admiral, it would be a second chance to save
the world--again in his own secret way. This time, instead of a covert
arms-for-hostages deal he would build the information equivalent of an
atomic bomb.
   Not a man of small ideas, Poindexter arrived at the meeting with Tether
prepared with a presentation titled "A Manhattan Project for Counter-
Terrorism." He would become the Edward Teller of the information age.
Like the old atomic-bomb development facility at Oak Ridge, Tennessee,
the facility that Poindexter envisioned would employ the best and the
brightest minds in computer science, physics, and information technol-
ogy. But instead of intending to explode trillions of electrons and protons
in a million different directions, Poindexter wanted to do the opposite. He
wanted to collect into one "ultra-large" data warehouse billions of seem-
ingly inconsequential bits of data and from that establish who might hijack
the next plane or blow up the next building or take down the next bridge.
He believed that with the right combination of hardware, software, and
brainpower, he would be able to tie the purchase of a Leatherman knife at
Target with a Web search on American Airlines and a speeding ticket in

Oklahoma and discover Nawaf al-Hazmi before he had a chance to board
Flight 77. "How are we going to find terrorists and preempt them, except
by following their trail?" asked Poindexter.
   In an atmosphere of hysteria, and with an administration unable to
shovel dollars into counterterrorism projects fast enough, it was an easy
sell. Tether said he would fund the project if Poindexter would run it.
Poindexter readily agreed, and by January 2002, what would possibly be-
come the largest data-surveillance system ever built was placed into the
hands of a man once convicted of five felony counts of lying to Congress,
destroying official documents, and obstructing congressional investiga-
tions. If Poindexter was a man of big ideas, he was also a man of big
scandals, a factor that didn't seem to bother Tether.
   During the Reagan administration, Poindexter was the highest-ranking
official to be found guilty during the Iran-Contra affair. He was sentenced
to prison by a federal judge who called him "the decision-making head"
of a plot to deceive Congress. Later, an appeals court overturned the con-
viction on a technicality, holding that the testimony Poindexter gave to
Congress about Iran-Contra was immunized, and therefore couldn't be
used against him at his trial.
   Dubbed the Information Awareness Office, Poindexter's organization
grew rapidly. With about $200 million in funding, Poindexter farmed out
much of the research into how to build such a system to a wide range of
corporations and universities that would do the heavy lifting. The compa-
nies were mostly large defense contractors such as Booz Allen Hamilton
and Raytheon, and small boutique intelligence consultancies like Hicks
& Associates. The universities ranged from Cornell and Columbia in the
east to the University of California at Berkeley in the west.
  Ted Senator, one of Poindexter's colleagues, used a metaphor to describe
the difficult task ahead in creating TIA. "Our task is akin to finding danger-
ous groups of needles hidden in stacks of needle pieces," he said. "This is
much harder than simply finding needles in a haystack: we have to search
through many stacks, not just one; we do not have a contrast between shiny,
hard needles and dull, fragile hay; we have many ways of putting the pieces
together into individual needles and the needles into groups of needles; and
we cannot tell if a needle or group is dangerous until it is at least partially
assembled. So, in principle at least, we must track all the needle pieces all
of the time and consider all possible combinations."

   As with a prefabricated mansion, each contractor worked on a separate
section of TIA. Among them was the Evidence Extraction and Link Dis-
covery program, which Ted Senator described to a group of technologists
in 2002:


  We've all seen what's meant by links and relationships in the past
   year. Many newspaper articles have appeared about the events of
   September 11, typically accompanied by very nice graphics that
   show the relationships between the hijackers--some roomed to-
   gether in Hamburg, some had airline tickets purchased on the same
   credit card at the same time, some traveled to Las Vegas at the same
   time, and the pilots trained together and, most important to our abil-
   ity to have detected the plot in advance, engaged in suspicious and
   unexplainable behavior that was reported during this training. These
   articles had as their theme: "we had the information but didn't put
   it together."
      And that is what EELD is all about: developing techniques that
   allow us to find relevant information--about links between people,
   organizations, places, and things--from the masses of available
   data, putting it together by connecting these bits of information into
   patterns that can be evaluated and analyzed, and learning what pat-
   terns discriminate between legitimate and suspicious behavior.


   TIA also included Scalable Social Network Analysis (SSNA), which
was projected to distinguish potential terrorist cells from ordinary groups
of people through an analysis of various everyday activities, such as
telephone calls, ATM withdrawals, and meetings; and Activity, Recog-
nition, and Monitoring (ARM), which sought to develop computerized
cameras capable of watching, recording, and learning how people act
and behave--to "capture human activities in surveillance environments."
In other words, the object was to develop hidden cameras to determine
whether someone was acting out of the ordinary. Finally, oblivious to
calling attention to the Orwellian nature of his new organization, Poin-
dexter personally designed an official seal for the Information Awareness
Office with a pyramid topped by a piercing, disembodied, all-seeing eye.
  Within a month of opening for business, Poindexter began reaching
out to the intelligence community--his future customers--and offering


                                       103

                           B O O K T W O : T A R G E T S

them a portal to his operation. This was a highly secret computer network
through which the various agencies could interact with TIA's sophisti-
cated systems. Agencies would access the network through a "node," a
dedicated desktop computer located within each agency. Among the agen-
cies interested was the NSA, which could never have enough computer
help to sift through and analyze its ocean of intercepts. By tying into the
TIA network, the agency would be able to experiment with new analyti-
cal software developed by Poindexter's group. To work out the arrange-
ment, Poindexter met with Hayden and the agency began installing the
TIA nodes. Once they were installed, the agency started running stacks of
intercepted e-mail and other communications through the system, testing
various programs and exchanging data with other intelligence community
users.
   In the fall of 2002, Poindexter's luck ran out when conservative New
York Times columnist William Safire, a staunch and longtime privacy advo-
cate, caught wind of both TIA and Poindexter. His resulting November 14
column, entitled "You Are Suspect," was merciless. Calling TIA "the su-
persnoop's dream," he went on to say, "Here is what will happen to you":


   Every purchase you make with a credit card, every magazine sub-
   scription you buy and medical prescription you fill, every Web site
  you visit and e-mail you send or receive, every academic grade you
   receive, every bank deposit you make, every trip you book and ev-
   ery event you attend--all these transactions and communications
   will go into what the Defense Department describes as "a virtual,
   centralized grand database."


   Safire was no less severe on Poindexter himself, calling him "the dis-
graced admiral." Others, including members of Congress, quickly jumped
on the bandwagon and TIA went on life support. The end for Poindexter
finally came when it was discovered that one of his programs involved
a bizarre use of stock-market techniques to predict potential terrorist at-
tacks. He resigned on August 29 and a month later House and Senate
leaders came to agreement on scrapping the funding for TIA.
   Rather than truly dying, however, the controversial domestic data min-
ing operation simply slipped deeper into the shadows--and ended up at
the NSA.

I n the days immediately following the attacks, General Hayden had a
  major decision to make. He had to decide whether to continue to go
forward with his massive, long-term reorganization plan, designed to re-
vitalize the NSA's workforce and modernize its worldwide eavesdrop-
ping network, or quickly change gears to focus on the immediate terrorist
threat. On September 13, he called a meeting in his office.
  "We had all the senior leadership of the agency in this room," said
Hayden. "About thirty-five people . . . all the key leaders. We had them
all in the room. I said, `Okay, we had a plan and we had a transforma-
tional road map and we made some decisions, now this [9/11] has hap-
pened. Do we need to revisit any of the trajectories that we put the agency
on?' And this was one of those frank and wide-ranging discussions. Ev-
ery man and woman in the room said, `Go faster. No change in direction.
If anything, accelerate all the changes under way.' "
   Ironically, at a time when most of the intelligence agencies were re-
calling previously retired workers, the NSA went ahead with their plan to
offer incentives for employees to take early outs. "This was within thirty
days of the attack," said Hayden, "with the whole system stretched by the
challenges of the new war. We had a lot of people leave and actually paid
some people to leave."
   The problem was that many of the people at the NSA had the right
skills for the wrong targets. The agency had to move out many of the
longtime Soviet linguists and high-frequency specialists to make room


                                    105

                           B O O K T W O : T A R G E T S

for Urdu and Dari speakers, and experts at dissecting and reverse-engi-
neering the Internet. "We could not squeeze any more juice out of retrain-
ing," said Hayden. "We had spent a decade trying to retrain people for
the new kinds of missions, and now it was time to get new people in here.
And the only way you can get new people in here is to let other people
go. And we were criticized for that. Someone who's as good at her job as
[Congresswoman] Jane Harmon, the senior member on the [House Intel-
ligence Committee, who] pays a lot of attention to us and is very consci-
entious and comes out to visit us and is very supportive, even she kind of
said, `What is this all about?' and said so in a public way. And I quietly
pointed out to her, `It was a tough decision, but it was a right decision.' "
  The NSA's personnel problems began in the early 1990s with the end of
the Cold War. "We were a third smaller at the end of the 1990s than we
were at the beginning," said Hayden. "We downsized in the worst possible
way--we shut the front door. For most of the decade of the 1990s, we hired
fewer than two hundred people a year--civilians--in an agency that had over
twenty thousand civilians in 1990; [we had] fifteen thousand by 2000." By
2004, according to Hayden, the new recruits had jumped to 1,500 a year.
   But of those numbers, the largest group hired were not code breakers but
security guards. "Garrison no longer equates to sanctuary," said Hayden.
"So we're hiring guards. We're renting some, too. Number two, we've in-
creased our polygraphers. Number three, linguists. Number four, analysts.
And there almost ain't a number five . . . We focused on what I call wartime
languages--Arabic, all the languages of Afghanistan, and then selected
languages in other parts of the world, [like the] Horn of Africa." The man
in charge of hiring and recruiting was Harvey Davis. "We let the hiring
program atrophy," he said, referring to the 1990s. "But now there is a trans-
formation under way, and we are recruiting and hiring at a feverish pace."
  At the same time, entire departments quickly packed up and shipped
out to the Middle East. Many took with them small, transportable "suit-
case kits," packed with eavesdropping equipment for targeting suspected
terrorists. Made by SWS Securities, a small NSA contractor, they could
handle rugged terrain and track low-powered radio transmissions, the
kind produced by people in hiding and using shortwave radios and gen-
erators. They were also capable of detecting smaller signals obscured by
large transmitters. Designed only for short-term use before disposal, they
lasted about six weeks.


                                      106

                                   H U N T E R S

   But according to Steve Uhrig, the president of SWS, bin Laden and
his men had the advantage. "Anyone with a little computer understand-
ing could get something up and running for him," he said. "If he kept his
transmissions short, moved frequently, he could even put the transmitter
ten miles away from where he is, run a ground microwave relay to a hill-
top, and bounce it off a satellite; put it under an oil company's name . . . It
could provide the perfect cover." For security, employees and their kits
were picked up at local parking lots, rather than at their homes or at the
agency, and driven to Baltimore-Washington International Airport. Back
at headquarters, many employees worked round the clock. "When people
say they are going to meet at eight," said one, "you have to ask if they
mean eight in the morning or eight at night."
   On the eighth floor of Ops 2B, Michael Hayden sought to restore a
feeling of normalcy and confidence at the NSA. He also knew that there
would be an immediate effort to push the NSA to the brink of the abyss.
"On the thirteenth of September," said Hayden, "I gave an address to an
empty room, but we beamed it throughout our entire enterprise, about
free peoples always having to decide the balance of security and their
liberties, and that we through our tradition have always planted our ban-
ner way down here on the end of the spectrum toward security [possibly
meant liberty]. And then I told the workforce . . . there are going to be a
lot of pressures to push that banner down toward security, and our job at
NSA was to keep America free by making Americans feel safe again. So
this balance between security and liberty was foremost in our mind."
   But it was Hayden himself who would grab the banner and lead the
charge away from liberty and toward a security state. As the smoke
cleared, and the details about Mihdhar and Hazmi and the Yemen ops
center began to emerge, he knew exactly what had happened. Worried
about congressional concerns over privacy, unhappy about the public's
image of the NSA as an evil eavesdropper, and hoping to avoid the slip-
pery slope that led to the Church and Pike Committee investigations of
the 1970s, he had turned a deaf ear to signals heading into the U.S. from
suspected terrorist locations overseas. This despite the fact that closely
monitoring these communications was part of his responsibility--pro-
vided certain FISA court rules were followed.
   Hayden had preferred instead to play it safe and leave those commu-
nications to the FBI, which had neither the technology nor the capability


                                       107

                           B O O K T W O : T A R G E T S

to do that type of collection. "I had an agency," said Hayden, "that, you
know, for decades--well, since the mid-1970s--had, frankly, played a bit
back from the line so as not to get close to anything that got the agency's
fingers burned in the Church-Pike era." As a result, the agency limited
the monitoring of international communications to foreign diplomatic es-
tablishments in Washington and New York and a half dozen other FISA
targets. Mihdhar and Hazmi were not among them.
   But the times had now changed, and Hayden changed with them. Civil
liberties were out, Fortress America was in. Even Hayden's ever-present
football metaphors became more aggressive. "We're going to live on the
edge," he would say. "My spikes will have chalk on them." In Haydenese,
launching war against al-Qaeda became "playing a little offense rather
than having a perpetual first down and goal on the three-yard line in the
homeland." He would often say that the NSA had long been "gatherers"--
passively picking information from the airwaves as it passed by. Now they
would become "hunters," actively going after that information wherever
it was.
   Almost immediately after the attacks, Hayden beefed up the cover-
age of communications between Afghanistan and the U.S. Then, on his
own initiative and without White House approval, he dropped the FISA-
mandated rule of minimization on those communications, leaving in the
names and other details of American citizens without court approval.
   Soon thereafter, Vice President Dick Cheney called George Tenet and
asked him if the NSA could do more. "I called Mike to relay the vice
president's inquiry," said Tenet. "Mike made it clear that he could do
no more within the existing authorities." Nine months earlier, soon after
Bush and Cheney were elected, Hayden had presented them with a top-
secret transition book outlining the challenges and limitations his agency
was facing, noting both the fiber-optic revolution and FISA's limitations.
   "The volumes and routing of data make finding and processing nuggets of
intelligence information more difficult," it said. The best way to find those
nuggets, Hayden suggested in the report, was to tap into the worldwide tele-
communications web--voice as well as data--to "live on the network," even
though that meant picking up many American communications. Hayden's
recommendation was to make the NSA "a powerful, permanent presence
on a global telecommunications network that will host the `protected' com-
munications of Americans as well as the targeted communications of adver-


                                      108

                                  H U N T E R S

saries." In other words, tap into the international communications flowing
into and out of the U.S., something he had been reluctant to aggressively
pursue prior to the attacks on 9/11 due to concern over FISA.
  "We went to see the vice president together," Tenet said. "Mike laid out
what could be done . . . We began to concentrate on the possible connec-
tions between the domestic front and the data we were collecting over-
seas. We would identify al-Qaeda members and other terrorists overseas
and often discover that they had relatives, acquaintances, or business ties
in the United States. Each rock overturned abroad led to ants scurrying
every which way, including many toward the United States."
   The next meeting was in the White House with the president. Seated
around the long conference table in the Situation Room with Bush, Cheney,
and Condoleezza Rice were the key intelligence chiefs. Hayden, the kid
from "the Ward," Pittsburgh's tough North Side, was a man impressed
with power. He once beamed as he boasted of going to a baseball game
with Rice. Now the president of the United States was putting his arm
around him and calling him "Mikey," his childhood nickname. "Is there
anything more we could be doing, given the current laws?" Bush asked
the gathering. "There is," said Hayden. He then gave the president a brief
summary of the NSA's signals intelligence operations against al-Qaeda.
  "He showed me the plans for this country to pick up a conversation,"
said Bush, "listen to conversations from people outside the country, inside
the country, who had an affiliation with al-Qaeda, or were al-Qaeda. He
said, `I think we can design a program, Mr. President, that will enable us
to have a quick response to be able to detect and deter a potential attack.'
I said, `That's interesting, General.' I said, `That makes a lot of sense to
me.' I said, `You're not going to listen inside the country.' [He said,] `No,
this is calls from outside the country in, or inside out, to people who we
know or suspect are affiliated with al-Qaeda.' And I remember some of
those phone calls coming out of California prior to September the 11th
attacks by the killers--just thinking maybe if we'd have listened to those
on a quick response basis, you know, it might have helped prevent the
attacks. My second question was, is it legal?"
   Hayden then brought up FISA and complained that it was designed for
an earlier period of time. It was designed for the 1970s, he said, when in-
ternational communications signals, its principal focus, traveled through
the air and domestic calls, which they were prohibited from monitoring,


                                      109

                              B O O K T W O : T A R G E T S

were transmitted over wires. Thus the law placed most restriction on the
wired communications. "When the law was passed," he said, "almost all
local calls were on a wire and almost all long-haul communications were
in the air. In an age of cell phones and fiber optic cables, that has been
reversed . . . with powerful and unintended consequences for how NSA
can lawfully acquire a signal." To correct the problem, Hayden proposed
a new concept: "hot pursuit."
   Under FISA, if the NSA was eavesdropping on the Yemen ops center
and a call was made to the U.S., the intercept operator could legally listen
in as long as the target was in Yemen. But as soon as the two parties hung
up, the NSA intercept operator might want to begin targeting the American
number immediately. "From that decision to coverage is measured in min-
utes," Hayden said. Because the person is in the U.S., however, the NSA
would now have to get a FISA warrant to begin targeting that number, a
process Hayden claimed was "slow and cumbersome." Instead he told the
president he wanted authority to secretly bypass the court and begin moni-
toring all of the target's international communications immediately--in
other words, "in hot pursuit." The standards for what represented a "rea-
sonable" intrusion into Americans' privacy had changed, Hayden said, "as
smoke billowed from two American cities and a Pennsylvania farm field."
   FISA, however, already provided for "hot pursuit"--it allowed inter-
cept operators to begin listening immediately, as long as they would apply
for the warrant within three days. Yet even that was too cumbersome and
time-consuming for Hayden and Bob Deitz, Hayden's top lawyer at the
NSA, who argued that the whole exercise was a waste of both time and
paper--a total bother. "The problem with the seventy-two-hour rule," he
said, is that "it is not a freebie. It is not you get to do whatever you want
for seventy-two hours . . . My concern is not lawyer time, although that
is precious enough. My concern is analyst time, and the issue that most
concerns us is your counterterrorism experts and analysts do not grow on
trees . . . Analysts talk to each other. They do memoranda. They pass the
memoranda on to shift supervisors . . . Then it has to go to our lawyers.
Then it has to go to a group of lawyers at the Department of Justice;
and then, ultimately, it has to go to the attorney general." And then there
was all that paper. "FISA applications," he said, "now are approximately
three-fourths of an inch thick. That is paper producing . . . I suggest that
that is simply a waste of that paper and effort and analysts' time."

   But in a democracy, eavesdropping on citizens, the most intrusive act a
government can perform, has traditionally been done with care and delib-
eration, checks and balances, lest the government itself become the enemy.
Eavesdropping in East Germany during the Cold War was very quick and
efficient--and therefore pervasive. And during that same period, eaves-
dropping by the NSA rapidly accelerated due to limited outside oversight.
Hayden's real problem today was not so much velocity--speed--as it
was volume; he wanted to be able to target thousands of people simulta-
neously, some briefly and some long term, without the hassle of justify-
ing them to anyone higher than an anonymous shift supervisor.
   In fact, according to James Baker, the Justice Department official most
familiar with the FISA court as the head of the Office of Intelligence Pol-
icy and Review since 2002, the warrants can be handled as quickly as in
a matter of minutes. "We've done it in a matter of a day; we've done it in
a matter of hours; we've done it in a matter of minutes," he said in 2007.
"Very rapidly. Extremely rapidly . . . The point is, there's been no loss of
foreign intelligence information. That's the key thing . . . The American
people have not been put at any risk because of this process going on."
   Nor, he said, were there any technical advances that prevented the
court from doing its job. "The Congress in 1978," he said, "wanted to
enable the government to collect all that information . . . I just want the
American people to be reassured that there's not some pot of electrons out
there floating around that we can't somehow get at technically because
of the regime that FISA sets up . . . I submit that FISA works today. I
believe that it's been effective in protecting the American people from
threats from foreign powers, from hostile terrorist groups, from hostile
foreign governments, and at the same time it's been effective in protect-
ing the American people's privacy."
   For years Hayden had avoided targeting Americans as much as pos-
sible. One slip and it was headlines and congressional hearings. But Mi-
chael Hayden was a man who spent his life tacking whichever way the
political winds happened to be blowing, and now he would simply tack
again, this time far to starboard. His goal was always to stay afloat and
make it to the next larger port. For Hayden, that now required jettisoning
the FISA court and launching his own top-secret eavesdropping opera-
tion at home against American citizens. The NSA would now become an
agency of hunters.

A    s far as Michael Hayden was willing to go, Cheney wanted to go
     much further--to even allow the NSA to eavesdrop on purely domes-
tic to domestic communications, phone calls as well as e-mail, without a
warrant. If people within the U.S. with suspected links to al-Qaeda made
calls, even to the house next door, Cheney believed the NSA should be
tapping in, regardless of FISA. "Either we're serious about fighting the
war on terror or we're not," he said. "Either we believe that there are
individuals out there doing everything they can to try to launch more at-
tacks, to try to get ever deadlier weapons to use against us, or we don't.
The president and I believe very deeply that there's a hell of a threat, that
it's there for anybody who wants to look at it. And that our obligation and
responsibility given our job is to do everything in our power to defeat the
terrorists. And that's exactly what we're doing."
   Cheney's position was shared by his longtime aide and top legal advi-
sor, forty-four-year-old David S. Addington, who became the chief le-
gal architect of the warrantless eavesdropping program. He once told a
senior Justice Department lawyer, "We're one bomb away from getting
rid of that obnoxious [FISA] court." "He and the vice president had ab-
horred FISA's intrusion on presidential power ever since its enactment in
1978," said Jack Goldsmith, who headed the Justice Department's Office
of Legal Counsel during the Bush administration--which he would later
label "the terror presidency." "After 9/11 they and other top officials in




                                    112

                                    F I S A

the administration dealt with FISA the way they dealt with other laws
they didn't like: they blew through them in secret based on flimsy legal
opinions they guarded closely so no one could question the legal basis for
the operations."
   One reason why Cheney and Addington hated the court was its ten-
dency to resist attempts by the Bush administration to push beyond the
legal boundaries, even before the attacks of 9/11. Judges on the court
kicked back more wiretap requests from the Bush administration than
from the four previous presidential administrations combined. In its first
twenty-two years, the court modified only two FISA eavesdropping re-
quests out of the 13,102 applications that were approved. And in twenty
of the first twenty-one annual reports issued by the court, up until 1999,
the Justice Department reported that no orders were modified or denied.
But beginning with the arrival of George W. Bush in 2001, the judges
modified 179 of the 5,645 requests for court-ordered surveillance and
rejected or deferred at least six--the first outright rejections in the court's
history--between 2003 and 2004.
   Nevertheless, of all the courts in the history of the United States, it
is likely none has ever been as accommodating to government lawyers.
Such facts worry Jonathan Turley, a George Washington University law
professor who worked for the NSA as an intern while in law school in
the 1980s. The FISA "courtroom," hidden away on the top floor of the
Justice Department building (because even its location is supposed to be
secret), is a heavily protected, windowless, bug-proof SCIF. "When I first
went into the FISA court as a lowly intern at the NSA, frankly, it started
a lifetime of opposition for me to that court," said Turley. "I was shocked
with what I saw. I was convinced that the judge in that SCIF would have
signed anything that we put in front of him. And I wasn't entirely sure
that he had actually read what we put in front of him. But I remember
going back to my supervisor at NSA and saying, `That place scares the
daylights out of me.' "
   The FISA judges are also agreeable to calls twenty-four hours a day if
the NSA or FBI has an urgent warrant request. On one Saturday in April
2002, for example, four cars filled with FBI agents suddenly pulled up to
the front door of the home of Royce C. Lamberth. A bald and burly fifty-
nine-year-old Texan with a fondness for John Grisham novels, he was




                                    113

                             B O O K T W O : T A R G E T S

mowing his lawn at the time. But rather than arrest him, the agents were
there to request an emergency court hearing to obtain seven top-secret
warrants to eavesdrop on Americans.
   As the presiding justice of the FISA court, Lamberth had become ac-
customed to holding the secret hearings in his living room. "My wife,
Janis . . . has to go upstairs because she doesn't have a Top Secret clear-
ance," he said. "My beloved cocker spaniel, Taffy, however, remains at
my side on the assumption that the surveillance targets cannot make her
talk. The FBI knows Taffy well. They frequently play with her while I
read some of those voluminous tomes at home." FBI agents will even
knock on the judge's door in the middle of the night. "On the night of the
bombings of the U.S. embassies in Africa, I started the first emergency
hearings in my living room at 3:00 a.m.," recalled Lamberth, who was
first appointed to the court in 1995. "From the outset, the FBI suspected
bin Laden, and the surveillances I approved that night and in the ensuing
days and weeks all ended up being critical evidence at the trial in New
York."
   Lamberth, who first decided to become a lawyer at age seven, became
a thorn in the side of the Bush administration soon after the inauguration.
"Those who know me know the chief justice did not put me on this court
because I would be a rubber stamp for whatever the executive branch was
wanting to do," he said. "I ask questions." In March, he sent a letter to
Attorney General John Ashcroft raising questions about a FISA request
to eavesdrop on a member of Hamas, the militant Palestinian group. The
issue involved whether the FBI was seeking authority to eavesdrop on
targets without informing the court of pending criminal investigations
involving the subject's status. FISA judges were always concerned that
investigators might use the court, with its lower probable cause standard,
as a back door to obtain eavesdropping warrants in standard criminal
cases--something that was forbidden. Given Lamberth's conscientious-
ness and the fact that the court was rejecting an increasing number of
FISA applications, Cheney and Addington began looking for a way to
bypass the troublesome court altogether.
   Enacted by a bipartisan Congress in 1978, FISA was a response to
revelations that the NSA had conducted warrantless eavesdropping on
Americans. To deter future presidents and NSA directors from ever again
bypassing the court and the warrant procedure, Congress put sharp teeth


                                        114

                                    F I S A

in the statute, making violation a felony punishable by a $10,000 fine and
five years in prison. Hard time. And each warrantless interception was a
separate violation.
    Cheney was undeterred. The 9/11 attack occurred on his watch and
he was determined not to let something like it happen again. He also had
serious disagreements with even the existence of FISA, an impediment
on presidential power that he believed "served to erode the authority I
think the president needs to be effective, especially in a national security
area." He turned to Attorney General Ashcroft to find a way to get around
it. Ashcroft, in turn, handed the assignment to John C. Yoo, an extremely
aggressive, thirty-four-year-old Bush appointee who advocated for un-
precedented presidential powers in times of war. He was also greatly
impressed with the NSA. "Sigint [signals intelligence] is even more im-
portant in this war than in those of the last century," he said.
   Yoo argued forcefully to Ashcroft and Cheney that both the agency's
weapons and the law were a product of the last century. "The government
had to figure out how to tap into al-Qaeda's communications networks,"
he said. "We can't say well, that line is the devoted line for Osama bin
Laden to talk to his lieutenants. Or we know they use that frequency, be-
cause they use the Internet, and they use cell phones and telephone calls
just like you and I do. No. This is a good example of where existing laws
were not up to the job, because under existing laws like FISA, you have
to have the name of somebody, have to already suspect that someone's
a terrorist before you can get a warrant. You have to have a name to put
in the warrant to tap their phone calls, and so it doesn't allow you as a
government to use judgment based on probability, to say: `Well, 1 percent
probability of the calls from or maybe 50 percent of the calls are coming
out of this one city in Afghanistan, and there's a high probability that
some of those calls are terrorist communications. But we don't know the
names of the people making those calls.' You want to get at those phone
calls, those e-mails, but under FISA you can't do that."
   Ten days after the attacks, Yoo wrote an internal memorandum arguing
that the NSA could use "electronic surveillance techniques and equip-
ment that are more powerful and sophisticated than those available to law
enforcement agencies in order to intercept telephonic communications
and observe the movement of persons but without obtaining warrants for
such uses." He noted that while such unprecedented and intrusive actions


                                    115

                             B O O K T W O : T A R G E T S

might be rejected on constitutional grounds during normal times, they are
now justified as a result of the 9/11 attacks. During such times, he said,
"the government may be justified in taking measures which in less trou-
bled conditions could be seen as infringements of individual liberties."
  Yoo thought that constitutional guarantees instantly evaporate follow-
ing a terrorist attack. "It appears clear that the Fourth Amendment's war-
rant requirement does not apply to surveillance and searches undertaken
to protect the national security from external threats," he said. In another
memo, this one to Alberto Gonzales, the White House counsel, he reiter-
ated his view that the president's powers trump the Constitution. "Our
office recently concluded," he wrote, "that the Fourth Amendment had
no application to domestic military operations."
   Hayden, not privy to the Justice Department's legal opinions, said he
relied on the legal advice of his general counsel, Robert L. Deitz, and
his staff for his decision to go along with the warrantless surveillance
program. "Three guys," Hayden said, "whose judgment I trust; three
guys who have advised me and who have told me not to do things in the
past--and laid out the questions. And they came back with a real comfort
level that this was within the president's authority . . . It probably would
have presented me with a--with a bit of a dilemma if the NSA lawyers
had said, no, we don't think so. But they didn't."
   Given that neither Deitz nor any other NSA lawyer was trusted by the
White House with the legal rationale for what they were doing, how could
his lawyers evaluate the decision? It rather calls their "comfort level" into
question. "Before I arrived [in October 2003]," said Jack Goldsmith, "not
even NSA lawyers were allowed to see the Justice Department's legal
analysis of what NSA was doing." He added, "They did not want the legal
analysis scrutinized by anyone, even inside the executive branch."
   Except for the presiding judge, Royce Lamberth, the FISA court was
also kept in the dark about the NSA's warrantless program. But rather
than being asked for his view on the legality of the operation, Lamberth,
probably the most experienced person in the country on the topic, was
simply told that this was a presidential decision, period. The meeting,
with Hayden and Yoo, took place in the office of Attorney General John
Ashcroft. During the meeting, which lasted nearly an hour, Lamberth
said little and agreed to keep his fellow judges uninformed. "It was clear
no one was asking him to approve it," said one person at the meeting.


                                        116

                                   F I S A

"That was absolutely clear." Years later Lamberth would harshly criticize
the program. "We have to understand you can fight the war [on terror-
ism] and lose everything if you have no civil liberties left when you get
through fighting the war."
   While Lamberth believed he had no legal power to prevent the presi-
dent's actions--or even disclose them--he did make an attempt to keep
any of the FISA cases that entered his court free of taint from the pro-
gram. He did this by insisting that the Justice Department flag any FISA
requests that were based, in any way, on the warrantless program. Lam-
berth had initially become alarmed when a number of requests crossing
his desk failed to indicate the origin of the evidence of probable cause
that was being presented--evidence, he believed, that originated from
warrantless eavesdropping. By the time the NSA operation was up and
running in the fall of 2001, between 10 and 20 percent of all the requests
coming into the FISA court were tainted by what is known in the legal
profession as "the fruit of the poisonous tree," that is, the warrantless
program.
   When Lamberth's tour on the court ended in 2002, he was succeeded
by Colleen Kollar-Kotelly, like Lamberth a district court judge in the Dis-
trict of Columbia. She was also briefed on the program and continued to
maintain the "firewall" separating legal FISA requests from the warrant-
less program. But the spillage into her court from the program became so
bad that Kollar-Kotelly decided she had to take action. She insisted that
the legal requests be accompanied by sworn affidavits--subject to per-
jury charges--attesting that the applications contained no product from
the warrantless operation.
   On October 1, Hayden gave a highly secret briefing to members of
the House and Senate intelligence committees regarding his ad hoc deci-
sion to drop the minimization requirements on the intercepts between
Afghanistan and the U.S. The fact that without even presidential ap-
proval the names of presumed-innocent Americans were now being sent
to the FBI, CIA, and other agencies surprised and angered a number of
those briefed, including Nancy Pelosi. A Democratic congresswoman
from California and the House minority leader, she was also the ranking
Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee. Hayden may also have
touched obliquely on the warrantless eavesdropping, which at that time
had not yet begun.


                                    117

                           B O O K T W O : T A R G E T S

   A few days later Pelosi sent a classified letter to Hayden expressing
her concerns about the agency's legal authority to expand its domestic
operations. In the briefing, she wrote, "you indicated that you had been
operating since the Sept. 11 attacks with an expansive view of your au-
thorities" with respect to electronic surveillance and intelligence-gather-
ing operations. "I am concerned whether, and to what extent, the National
Security Agency has received specific presidential authorization for the
operations you are conducting." In his response, Hayden acknowledged
that he had not gotten White House approval. "In my briefing," he wrote,
"I was attempting to emphasize that I used my authorities to adjust NSA's
collection and reporting."
   Just days after the briefing, on October 4, Hayden received authori-
zation to bypass the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court and begin
eavesdropping on international communications to and from Americans
without a warrant. Loaded with new money, freed of the FISA court, he
now turned his attention to building his new worldwide surveillance em-
pire.

                               Mission



I n early October, Mike Hayden met a group of employees in a large
  windowless conference room just down the hall from his office. Sit-
ting and standing around a giant doughnut-shaped table, they were the
charter members of the most secret operation in the nation's most secret
agency. They were also the first NSA employees since the mid-1970s to
eavesdrop on the phone calls and messages of American citizens without
a judicial warrant and in contravention to existing laws. In a very un-
usual move reflecting the questionable nature of the program, Hayden
made participation in it voluntary. Each person also had to sign a special
document acknowledging they had been briefed on the "special collec-
tion program" and agreeing under penalty of prison never to reveal any
details of it to anyone not specifically cleared for the mission. And like
its predecessors, Operations Shamrock and Minaret, it was also given a
code word, which itself was secret.
  "Let me tell you what I told them when we launched the program,"
said Hayden. "This is the morning of 6 October in our big conference
room--about eighty, ninety folks in there--and I was explaining what the
president had authorized, and I ended up by saying, `And we're going to
do exactly what he said, and not one photon or one electron more' . . . It
was very closely held. We had to read people into the program specifi-
cally . . . This was walled off inside NSA; that's the compartment that it
was in."
   As the first intercepts began appearing on computer screens and digital


                                    119

                           B O O K T W O : T A R G E T S

recorders that first Saturday in October, less than a month after the at-
tacks, one issue stood out above all others: whom to target. What criteria
were the intercept operators to use to decide whether the American on the
other end of that phone call or e-mail was linked to al-Qaeda or an inno-
cent citizen constitutionally guaranteed the right to privacy? Under FISA,
the Congress put that decision in the hands of the FISA court judges,
independent arbiters with great experience and knowledge in the law, as
well as extensive experience in determining whether there was probable
cause--the high standard required by the Fourth Amendment--to begin
targeting someone as a member of al-Qaeda.
   Hayden's secret program bypassed the judges and instead left those
decisions far down the food chain, to people with no legal training at all--
"shift supervisors," according to both Hayden and his top lawyer, Bob
Deitz. The NSA would become judge, jury, and eavesdropper all in one.
"I don't make those decisions," said Hayden. "The director of Sigint out
there doesn't make those decisions. Those decisions are made at the pro-
gram level and at the level of our counterterrorism officer." Defensively,
he noted, "I'm trying to communicate to you that the people who are do-
ing this, okay, go shopping in Glen Burnie and their kids play soccer in
Laurel. And they know the law. They know American privacy better than
the average American, and they're dedicated to it . . . This isn't a drift
net out there where we're soaking up everyone's communications. We're
going after very specific communications that our professional judgment
tells us we have reason to believe are those associated with people who
want to kill Americans. That's what we're doing." Deitz added, "So this
is not--this isn't simply Liberty Hall."
   In addition to the issue of impartial judge versus partial eavesdropper,
there is the question of different standards for deciding if an American
is somehow affiliated with a terrorist organization. "They're targeted on
al-Qaeda," said Hayden. "There is a probable cause standard. Every tar-
geting is documented. There is a literal target folder that explains the
rationale and the answers to the questions on a very lengthy checklist as
to why this particular [phone] number we believe to be associated with
the enemy."
   But the term "probable cause" at the NSA is a misnomer. In fact, their
standard is "reasonableness," which is much lower than that required by
both FISA and the Fourth Amendment. "The standard that is most ap-


                                      120

                                  M I S S I O N

plicable to the operations of NSA," said Hayden, "is the standard of rea-
sonableness, you know--is this reasonable?" He then gave an example
of how the warrantless system works. "NSA in the conduct of its foreign
intelligence work intercepts a communication from a known terrorist,
let's say in the Middle East, and the other end of that communication is
in the United States. There--one end of that communication involves a
protected person, all right? Everything NSA is doing is legal up to that
point. It is targeting the foreign end, it has a legitimate reason for target-
ing it, and so on, all right? But now, suddenly, we have bumped into the
privacy rights of a protected person, okay? And no warrant is involved,
okay? We don't go to a court. But through procedures . . . we must apply
a standard to protecting the privacy of that individual."
   Inevitably, mistakes are made and innocent people are targeted.
"Clearly," Hayden acknowledged, "I think logic would dictate that if
you're using a probable cause standard as opposed to absolute certitude,
sometimes you may not be right." But, he added defensively, that doesn't
make the initial decision wrong. "To put someone on targeting under NSA
anywhere in the world . . . and at some point end targeting doesn't mean
that the first decision was wrong, it just means this was not a lucrative
target for communications intelligence."
   The NSA's track record on accuracy, however, leaves much to be de-
sired. As even Hayden now admits, the agency got the war in Iraq com-
pletely wrong. "When we didn't find the weapons after the invasion and
the occupation," he said, "I brought our analysts in, NSA. Now, they're
not all source, they just do Sigint. And I said, `Come on, we got five
things out there, chem, bio, nukes, missiles, and UAVs, give me your
confidence level on each one . . . zero to ten, how confident were you on
the day we kicked off the war?' . . . Nukes was lowest at three, missiles
was highest at ten, everything else was five, seven, and eight . . . As we
went further into this--I had them back in a month or two later--their
whole tone and demeanor had changed. There was a lack of confidence.
Everything was being marshmallowed to me, a lot of possibles and could
haves and maybes and so on."
   The NSA scanned thousands of calls in the U.S. without a warrant,
some briefly and others for longer periods. Those considered suspi-
cious--about five hundred people at any one time during the beginning
of the program and about one hundred people by 2007--would become


                                      121

                            B O O K T W O : T A R G E T S

targets. Overseas the number of people targeted by the NSA on any par-
ticular day ranged from five thousand to seven thousand. Occasionally,
following the capture of an al-Qaeda computer or terrorist, the numbers
would jump as new names and phone numbers were discovered in data-
bases or phone books. Also, there was a built-in multiplier effect: if one
person was targeted and he was in communication with a dozen other
people about whom the agency became suspicious, they also could end
up on the NSA's phone-tree target list. And if a person in the U.S. seemed
particularly important, the NSA could then go to the FISA court, meet
the probable cause standard, and obtain a warrant to begin monitoring
his or her communications. According to Hayden, "There were other
circumstances in which clearly you wanted more than the coverage of
international communications, and under this authorization, you would
have to go to the FISA court in order to get a warrant for any additional
coverage."
   Had the warrantless eavesdropping system been in effect prior to 9/11,
Hayden insists, both Mihdhar and Hazmi would have been detected.
"I can demonstrate," he said, "how the physics and the math would
work . . . Had this been in place prior to the attacks, the two hijackers
who were in San Diego, Khalid al-Mihdhar and Nawaf al-Hazmi, almost
certainly would have been identified as who they were, what they were,
and most importantly, where they were." In fact, there was no need for
such a system. If Hayden had simply done as his job allowed and traced
the calls and e-mail back from the Yemen ops center and obtained a FISA
warrant for the California phone numbers and e-mail address, he would
have discovered who, what, and where they were back in the spring of
2000. And then by monitoring their domestic communications, the FBI
could have discovered the other members of the group.
   Those involved in the warrantless eavesdropping operation soon began
to realize its limitations. By gaining speed and freedom they sacrificed
order and understanding. Rather than focusing on the most important and
potentially productive targets, which was required when going through
the FISA court, they took a shotgun approach. They began monitoring
thousands and thousands of "al-Qaeda affiliates," all of which proved un-
productive, flooding the FBI with useless intercept reports, slowing down
legitimate investigations, and placing thousands of innocent names on
secret blacklists. The Do Not Fly list alone quickly ballooned from about

twenty to over forty thousand names, many generated by the NSA's war-
rantless program as the agency zoomed from dangerously underreacting
prior to 9/11 to dangerously overreacting afterward.
   For nearly thirty years, the NSA's massive ear had been locked in place
pointing outward. Now Hayden broke the lock and once again turned it
inward, eavesdropping on Americans without a warrant. Nearly rusted on
its pedestal and in need of new wiring, the NSA would require a major
overhaul, from the intercept stations on the front end to the powerful su-
percomputers in the center to the analytical teams on the back end.

T  he phone next to John Berry's bed rang shortly after 6:00 a.m. It was
   September 11, 2001, and his girlfriend, Sharilyn Bailey, had some ur-
gent news. "She told me to turn on the television and asked if my army
reserve unit had already called," he said. "I found the remote and clicked
on the set." Berry was a thirty-seven-year-old reporter for the Press-En-
terprise, a newspaper in the central California city of Riverside, where
his beat was Moreno Valley. Once a dry cattle-ranching and citrus-farm-
ing town built around March Air Force Base, Moreno Valley by 2001 had
become a sprawling, rapidly growing desert valley in the Inland Empire.
  The day before, Berry had been covering the debate over whether to
increase the town's landscaping fees. He never made it back to the city
council meeting. "As soon as I saw it on TV, I knew that my life was
about to change," he said. In addition to his work as a reporter, Berry
was also a reserve army warrant officer and an NSA Arabic linguist with
nearly twenty years of both active and reserve duty. "I knew the army
would be calling soon."




In the days and weeks following the attacks of 9/11, as the agency's bud-
get ballooned, General Hayden began an enormous building campaign.
His key focus was the agency's four highly secret U.S.-based eavesdrop-
ping locations in Georgia, Texas, Colorado, and Hawaii. After the Cold

War, the NSA closed down many of its listening posts around the world
and replaced them with much smaller, remotely operated facilities. The
intercept operators and analysts--mostly in the military--were then
moved back to the U.S. and consolidated in four giant operational centers
across the country, like eavesdropping factories. Three targeted separate
parts of the globe while a fourth downloaded data from satellites and
transmitted it to the others. To increase speed, the results would then be
forwarded directly to the users--military commanders on the front lines
and elsewhere around the world. A copy would also go to the NSA at Fort
Meade, as would traffic too hard to break or too difficult to analyze. What
Hayden needed most were Arabic linguists, and the military quickly be-
gan activating every one they could find. One of those was John Berry.




Like many NSA linguists, Berry had learned Arabic during an eighteen-
month tour at the Defense Language Institute at the Presidio of Monterey
in California. He was part of a small group of Arabic and Farsi (spoken in
Iran) linguists assigned to the 345th Military Intelligence Battalion based
in Georgia. Six times a year he would be flown there from California for
weekend reserve training. He was thus little surprised when on Septem-
ber 28 he picked up his phone at work and heard the smoke-laden voice
of the training sergeant. "Mr. Berry," he said. "You've been tapped." A
little more than a week later, Berry had filled two seventy-pound duffel
bags, stored his red 1996 Saturn in Sharilyn's garage (she also agreed to
take his two cats), and made arrangements for the army to hire a moving
company to clear out his apartment.
   Berry's next stop was Fort Bragg, North Carolina, where he would be
processed into active duty. He arrived on October 9, and when he wasn't
in long lines getting shots, having eye exams, or trying on gas masks, he
was running around looking for a phone jack for his computer in order to
check his e-mail. "They took a sliver of us--the Arabic linguists and the
Farsi linguists," he said.
    Elsewhere on the same base was another Arabic linguist who had been
activated. As Berry was hunting for outlets, twenty-four-year-old Ser-
geant Adrienne J. Kinne was sitting in a steel high chair being poked with
a needle. A native of Utica, New York, she had spent four years on active


                                      125

                             B O O K T W O : T A R G E T S

duty, from 1994 until 1998. Before her recall she was studying for her
master's degree at Augusta State University. The previous May she had
graduated from the University of Virginia. Both Berry and Kinne were
among the reservists called up from the 345th Military Intelligence Bat-
talion because of their language training in Arabic and Farsi. "There were
six of us from the 345th," said Berry. "I had known her [Kinne] since
1998. I was her language officer."
   Kinne described the command structure at Fort Bragg as constantly in
a state of confusion. "It's like one day we're going to go off to Uzbekistan,
another day it's we're going to get stationed at NSA, another day we're
going to be in Virginia somewhere. And then, lo and behold, they finally
got us our year-long orders and we were assigned back at Fort Gordon."
   Formerly known as the Georgia Regional Security Operations Cen-
ter and renamed NSA/CSS Georgia, the facility seemed ill-suited for its
purpose. It consisted of five buildings, including barracks and mess hall,
spread out over several miles, with the majority of operations carried out
in Back Hall, located on the corner of busy Chamberlain Avenue and
Twenty-fourth Street. Inside the old 90,920-square-foot classroom build-
ing, intercept operators, analysts, and their equipment were crammed
into small classrooms on opposite sides of wide hallways. It is there that
analysts may have monitored the communications flowing between the
Yemen ops center and Khalid al-Mihdhar and Nawaf al-Hazmi in San
Diego.
   During her first tour at the listening post in the mid to late nineties,
Kinne eavesdropped on Arabic military communications intercepted by
the NSA's signals intelligence satellites. "It would be collected by sat-
ellite over there and beamed back to us," she said. "It was all digital,
so you would be sitting at your computer and you would call up your
receiver . . . We had pre-programmed lists where it would target certain
frequencies and you could scan through that. So a lot of time you would
have four receivers going, two in each ear, and I would be just scan-
ning . . . I remember a couple of times when I was just recording three
different conversations at once."
   One of Kinne's principal targets was the Syrian military. "I could
transcribe it live, especially Syrian military," she said. "Pretty much you
would record anything that you heard because usually they would only be
on if they were talking about something militaristic or something." Kinne


                                        126

                                H I G H L A N D E R

said the targets included a broad swath of countries from North Africa to
most of the Middle East, including Israel. "We did have Hebrew linguists,"
she said. "They had different subgroups, so one was Syria, one was Le-
vantine area--Lebanon and Jordan. The PLO, I think, was in there. And
then there was Northern Africa Section--Egypt, Sudan, Algeria . . . We
worked the Levantine mission, and then another group right next to us
worked the North Africa mission . . . And eventually in that same room
they stood up the Iraqi mission."
   At the time, in the late 1990s, the listening post had about 1,200 people
assigned to it. But following the attacks on 9/11, that number quickly
doubled to 2,400 people. In the scramble for linguists, calls went out to
contractors such as Titan, which supplied several dozen, and ads were
placed in newspapers.
   As Berry and Kinne arrived at NSA Georgia in late November 2001,
technicians were overflowing into the hallways and crammed into tem-
porary trailers. The two were among the 350 intelligence reservists called
up and assigned to the 513th Military Intelligence Brigade following the
attacks. Because of their signals-intelligence and linguistic backgrounds,
the two were placed in the 201st Military Intelligence Battalion, which
specialized in Sigint. Berry became officer in charge of a top-secret pro-
gram code-named Highlander that eavesdropped on Inmarsat satellite
communications within the Middle East. Kinne worked for the program
as a linguist. "We were the pioneers. We got there before the system did.
And one day we saw these boxes in this room," said Berry. "We needed
to get thrown into the fight as soon as possible, and we got a system with
no instruction manual, and so we literally figured it out one keystroke at
a time . . . There was no guidance."
   While much of the NSA was hunting for bin Laden by targeting the
newer forms of communications, such as cell phones and the Internet,
Berry noted, Inmarsat satellite phones still provided a wealth of intel-
ligence. "Just because bin Laden drops that system, it doesn't mean other
people will," he said. "Maybe if you go after his secretary, somebody who
won't be using the latest technology, then it could be lucrative. It's like
your boss may be having the best, most secure phone ever, but the office
janitor won't be. They'll be using something you can intercept . . . Every-
body goes after the golden ring, thinking, for example, bin Laden may be
on the latest, most expensive thing, and it turns out you go a few levels


                                      127

                             B O O K T W O : T A R G E T S

below that, you find out a lot more . . . And that was absolutely amazing
what we pulled out. I look back on it and it was like, `How did you guys
[NSA] miss this?' All along this was there."
   To do this, the agency established a remote satellite interception ca-
pability at Camp Doha in Kuwait as the "front end" of the program. The
base was located within the spot beam of Inmarsat I-3 F1, launched in
1996 to cover the Middle East and Indian Ocean region, and the signals
were intercepted by a mobile antenna array known as Trojan Remote
Receiver-38 (TRR-38). The manager and her five coworkers on the site
were largely responsible for intercepting both sides of the conversations,
putting them together, and then relaying them in near real time--a few
minutes' delay--to NSA Georgia. "The two halves of the conversation
were recorded separately, but you could listen to them together," Kinne
noted. "They had one satellite phone and another satellite phone, and they
would match it up together. It's fairly close to live." According to Berry,
"It was like a big vacuum cleaner in the sky . . . We could listen to every-
thing." Berry also said that safety was a very big advantage. "As a platoon
leader, I didn't have to worry about our guys stepping on a land mine or
getting shot. Because of technology it could all be done remotely--our
biggest concern was weak coffee and bad drivers."
   The intercepted conversations, or "cuts" as they were called, were
transmitted to computers in the Highlander unit, where they would be
stored in a "queue" until Kinne and her fellow voice interceptors could
listen to them. "It would sort of collect everything from different satel-
lites in the area and beam it back to us," she said. "All this stuff was
prerecorded. You could basically set up the front end to collect any con-
versation, automatically record it, and send it back. It's five minutes old.
It's very near real time. It prerecorded everything, and at first everything
was unidentified; we would just get these thousands of cuts dumped on
us and they would just come up in our queue, and it was just like search-
ing blindly through all these cuts to see what the hell was what . . . and
we would slowly figure out some of the targets, like who went with what
phone number."
   After matching up the phone numbers with the callers, the unit began
constructing a "phone book" of targets. "We got a phone number; we
had to figure out who was on that phone number and if it was worth it,"
said Berry. "So we constructed our own phone book." Even unproduc-


                                        128

                                 H I G H L A N D E R

tive phone numbers were sometimes kept. "Six months later, Ahmed can
pass it [a cell phone] on to his brother, and it goes from being benign to
malicious . . . You constantly get this flow, and it came to be we were re-
ally good--we got good at separating the wheat from the chaff. We got a
lot of momentum going so that by the time Iraq started we were going full
steam, and I think we really contributed to the war effort."
    Because the system pulled in communications from the entire Middle
East, the conversations were in a wide variety of languages and dialects.
"It was Iraq, Afghanistan, and a whole swath of area. We would get Tajik,
Uzbek, Russian, Chinese," said Kinne. "It was just a big area--it was just
like putting a vacuum in the sky and sucking it down," added Berry. "And
it was up to us to figure it out as to whether it was good or not." Eliminat-
ing country codes from friendly countries, such as Kuwait, "would help
a lot," said Berry, "but these were mobile--a lot of them were mobile.
We don't know who it belongs to--here's a strange frequency showing
up, and until you listen to it you don't know. There's these thousands of
signals out there." When necessary, Berry could also call the NSA for
help. "It's like, hey, I've got a cut in whatever language--can you bring
somebody to come and look at it. And they would."
   As Kinne would switch to a new conversation, the phone numbers of
the parties as well as their names would appear on her digital screen.
"In our computer system, it would have the priority, the telephone num-
ber, the target's name," she said. This may have been as a result of a
secret agreement in which Inmarsat turned over to the NSA all of its
subscriber information. "And you could actually triangulate the loca-
tion of the phone if you wanted to. We could ask our analysts to figure
out the exact location of the phone," said Kinne. Eventually, as the NSA
gathered phone numbers from its warrantless eavesdropping program and
from intelligence operations, those phone numbers would be sent down
to NSA Georgia to be programmed into the computers. "At some point
they started giving us, I don't know who, telephone numbers to program
into the system to specifically collect."
    But because al-Qaeda communicated far less by satellite phone af-
ter 9/11, and with little supervision of the intercept operators, much of
what they eavesdropped on were communications involving journalists,
nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) such as the Red Cross, and busi-
nesspeople. "There was no quality control; there were no senior linguists,"


                                       129

                             B O O K T W O : T A R G E T S

said Kinne. Berry also said there was little oversight from above, but saw
that as an advantage. "It was because we weren't being micromanaged is
why I think we were so successful. Because we just did it on our own, we
didn't have to clear it with anybody." Berry once asked a senior officer for
guidance but received little more than a pat on the head. "I said, `Is there
any guidance you want us to follow?' And he said, `Chief Berry, your
bubbas are doing fine, so just keep doing what you're doing.' And I said,
`Yes sir, that's what we'll do.' "
   Berry also briefed the NSA director Mike Hayden about the High-
lander program in March 2003, but Hayden expressed little interest. "He
said, `Son, just tell me in five minutes.' And I had this whole presentation
and I said, `Sir, we did this, this, and this.' He shook a few hands, gave
a coin to someone, and walked out the door. They said you have fifteen
minutes, but then they cut it to five right when he walked in the door."
The current NSA director, Lieutenant General Keith Alexander, was also
briefed on Highlander by Berry when Alexander was head of army intel-
ligence.
  "As time went on we just saw the queue and it would just fill up with a
lot of NGOs and humanitarian organizations and journalists," said Kinne.
While the journalists and others were originally picked up at random,
once in the system they then became permanent targets. "It's random at
first, but once it's identified and you know who it is, the system is pro-
grammed to intercept those cuts and send it into the system at whatever
priority we designated it as . . . And there was priority one through eight.
Priority one was terrorists, which we rarely had anything related to that.
And NGOs were priority five to seven, and journalists--all those were
priority five to seven. Eight was we didn't have a linguist to translate it,
and then nine was all the unidentified stuff."
   Berry says his operation conscientiously avoided eavesdropping on
Americans. "The thing is you can't listen to Americans, and I was very
careful that we never did because, one, it's illegal. Two, I realized that we
were in a kind of electronic minefield, so if I ever had a question about it
then I would call the NSA's lawyers and I would describe the situation to
them and they said yes, you can do this, you can't do that. They've got as
many lawyers as they've got parking spaces." The problem, he said, was




                                        130

                                H I G H L A N D E R

not knowing who was on the other end of an intercept. "You're sucking in
someone you don't know who it is until you listen to it."
   But Kinne said that even though the intercept operators knew they were
eavesdropping on American journalists communicating with other jour-
nalists and their families in the U.S., the decision was made to continue
listening to, recording, and storing the conversations. "Basically all rules
were thrown out the window and they would use any excuse to justify a
waiver to spy on Americans," said Kinne. "Because you could program
the system to pick up specific phone numbers, you could also program
the system to block phone numbers. And so we could have blocked the
humanitarian aid organizations and all those other ones, but they said
that we had to monitor them just in case they ever talked about--because
they were eyes on the ground--just in case they ever talked about see-
ing weapons of mass destruction anywhere and gave a location. Or in
case they ever lost their phone and some random terrorist picked it up
and started using it . . . And for those two reasons, we could listen to all
the NGOs, humanitarian aid organizations, and frigging journalists in the
area--continue to even after they were identified and we knew who they
were and that they weren't terrorists or terrorist-affiliated . . . So that was
the excuse they gave."
   Operation Highlander was an extraordinary and illegal expansion of
the original purpose of the new program, which was to eavesdrop on
Americans only when an NSA supervisor had a reasonable belief that the
person on the other end was a member of al-Qaeda. "If you're talking to
a member of al-Qaeda," said Bush, "we want to know why." But these
people were not members of al-Qaeda, and they weren't talking to terror-
ists. Nevertheless, according to Kinne, the standard operating procedure
was to keep recording them and not delete the numbers. "They were just
hesitant to ever block phone numbers or drop them from the system,"
said Kinne. "There were no really clear-cut rules. They activated twenty
reservists and stood up this elaborate high-tech mission and just said run
with it."
   Kinne had spent several years at NSA Georgia prior to the attacks on
9/11 and was shocked that they were now targeting Americans. The inter-
nal NSA regulations on handling communications involving U.S. persons
were spelled out in a top-secret document known as United States Signals




                                      131

                           B O O K T W O : T A R G E T S

Intelligence Directive 18 (USSID 18). "When I was on active duty before,
we took USSID 18 incredibly seriously, and I just remember collecting a
Syrian military cut once where in the report they mentioned an American
diplomat who was visiting the region by name. And because they men-
tioned the American's name, we deleted the cut, we deleted everything.
Maybe we didn't technically have to, maybe we could have just left his
name out of the report, but we deleted everything, and I think that just
goes to show the level to which we took USSID 18 incredibly seriously."
   Worried about violating not only NSA internal regulations but federal
law, Kinne says she brought her concerns to Berry. "I said we're not sup-
posed to be listening to these people--not only are we not supposed to
be listening to Americans, but there were five allied countries that we
were not supposed to monitor either--the Five Eyes. But we listened to
Australians, Canadians, Brits. And so it wasn't just the Americans but
that whole idea that you weren't supposed to monitor those five countries
either--citizens of those five countries . . . They told us that we could
monitor calls from there to the States but that we could only report on the
half of the conversation that took place in the Middle East. We couldn't
report on the half that took place in America. And when they waived
it, we could monitor these people in the Five Eyes. In reports, we just
couldn't reference their citizenship country of origin. So you could re-
port on the substance of the conversation, but not identify them as an
individual."
   Berry, however, again said his group never illegally eavesdropped on
Americans. But when asked, "Did you ever pick up information from
journalists, businesspeople, or humanitarian organizations?" he simply
said the answer was classified. "I can't answer that," he said. "I can't talk
about that." He added, "I made sure my soldiers did the right thing."
   The idea of permanently recording incredibly personal conversations
between Americans--husbands, wives, and lovers--greatly bothered
Kinne, and she made a personal decision to go out of her way to erase
them. "A lot of times I would just delete them," she said, "especially the
halves that were taking place in America because they were picked up
separately and recorded separately. I would just do that because I didn't
feel comfortable leaving it in the system and I didn't . . . A lot of time you
could tell they were calling their families, waking them up in the middle
of the night because of the time difference. And so they would be talking


                                      132

                                 H I G H L A N D E R

all quiet and soft, and their family member is like half asleep--incred-
ibly intimate, personal conversations--and I just can't believe they were
frigging recording them, and I don't know why they would ever have to
to begin with."
   Another Arabic voice interceptor at NSA Georgia who became aware
of the warrantless eavesdropping on Americans was David Murfee
Faulk, who worked there until November 2007. Following the attacks
on 9/11, Faulk, then thirty-two and a reporter at the Pittsburgh Tribune-
Review, joined the navy to help in the fight against Osama bin Laden.
With a master's degree in German from the University of Chicago, he
had a knack for languages and was sent to the Defense Language Insti-
tute in Monterey, California, for sixty-three weeks of Arabic training.
Upon graduation he was assigned as a cryptologic technician to NSA
Georgia, where he specialized in eavesdropping on Iraqi cell phone con-
versations in Baghdad. Among his friends at the listening post was an air
force Arabic translator working for an operation known as Cobra Focus,
which provided Sigint support to U.S. ground forces in Iraq.
   "One day he was ordered to transcribe every call that dropped in his
queue," said Faulk. "And the calls were all in English, they were all Amer-
ican, and the guy goes back to his supervisor, a warrant officer, and says,
`Sir, these people are all Americans--are there any USSID 18 questions
here?' He said, `No, just transcribe them, that's an order, transcribe ev-
erything.'" According to Faulk, the calls included intimate conversations
both within the Green Zone and to people back in the U.S. "There were
people having affairs inside the Green Zone, talking about their meet-ups,
just all kinds of stuff. And he transcribed everything word for word, and it
just disappeared into the big NSA black hole. These were military, civil-
ians, contractors. A lot of these people were having personal phone calls,
calling their families back home, having all kinds of personal discussions,
and everything just disappeared somewhere; someone's got it."
    Faulk's friend eventually told his warrant officer that he was troubled
by the work. "After a few days he said he didn't want to do it anymore,
didn't think it was right," said Faulk. "So they got somebody else to do
it. There is always somebody else who will do something like that. The
whole agency down here, at least the way it operates in Georgia, there's
a lot of intimidation, everybody's afraid of getting in trouble, and people
just follow orders. They're told, `Yeah, we already ran this by the le-


                                       133

                             B O O K T W O : T A R G E T S

gal department up at Meade and it's kosher,' and it may or may not be
true . . . They generally aren't told the reason for the order--they just
say we've cleared this, it's legal, so listen to it. I know about three cases
where that was done . . . But people generally do what they're told. That's
what really disturbed me down here with the whole discussion of war-
rantless wiretapping--if we wanted to just start tapping random Ameri-
cans' phones, I think we'd have enough workers willing to do that. I think
it's frightening. I think it's very frightening."
   In 2002, one of the Inmarsat phone calls picked up by the NSA came
from a group of suspected terrorists crossing a vast expanse of desert in
a remote part of Yemen.

                         Assassination



F  or years, one of the people near the top of the NSA's target list was
   Qaed Salim Sinan al-Harethi, a native Yemeni suspected of belonging
to al-Qaeda and of being one of the masterminds behind the attack on the
USS Cole two years before. After listening to hours of tape recordings of
his conversations, the small team assigned to locate al-Harethi was very
familiar with the sound of his voice. But like most of the NSA's targets, al-
Harethi knew that the United States was searching for him with an elec-
tronic dragnet, hoping to snag a brief satellite phone call and pinpoint his
location. As a result he always carried with him up to half a dozen phones,
each with multiple cards that could change the number. The NSA had a
list of at least some of the numbers, and because he was a high-priority
target, an alarm would go off if one of them was used.
   On the afternoon of November 3, 2002, the alarm sounded, surpris-
ing one of the analysts on the team. "He knew this guy's phone number
and he [al-Harethi] hadn't used it for a period of time--it was a satellite
phone," said one knowledgeable source. "Then it came up." Using global
positioning satellites, he was able to pinpoint al-Harethi in the Yemeni
province of Mar'ib, a remote, sand-swept landscape controlled by well-
armed tribal chiefs and largely off-limits to Yemeni police. The analyst
quickly contacted a CIA team based across the Red Sea in Djibouti. From
the small country on the Horn of Africa, the CIA operated a battery of un-
manned Predator drones, each armed with deadly Hellfire missiles. From
there, the drones could easily reach anywhere in Yemen, where at least


                                    135

                            B O O K T W O : T A R G E T S

one was already on patrol. Thus, almost immediately the CIA in Djibouti
began directing the Predator toward the target.
   But the NSA analyst, eavesdropping on the satellite call in near real
time, was disappointed. Having listened to tapes of al-Harethi's voice
many times over the years, he was convinced the person on the other end
of the phone was not him. "This guy is listening and he realizes it's not
the guy," said the source. "And all of a sudden he hears like a six-sec-
ond conversation and it's the guy, he's in the backseat and he's giving the
driver directions and it was picked up over the phone, and the analyst was
that good that he heard over all the other stuff. He said, `That's him.' But
because they have to have a dual recognition, he called in the second guy,
they played the tape, and they said, `It's him.' Forty minutes later a Hell-
fire missile hit that car. The Predator was already up doing surveillance.
The CIA said to the Predator team, `Here's the general location--from
NSA--that we have the satellite phone, go find the damn car and get the
guy.' Those analysts get that good, they can recognize the voice. The CIA
took credit for that because it was a CIA Predator that fired the shot that
killed the guy. But the way they killed him was an NSA analyst listening."
   The black all-terrain vehicle instantly burst into a ball of flames, kill-
ing all five of the occupants and leaving little more than charred metal
and a sprawling oil stain on the desert sand. Also in the car was Kamel
Derwish, an American citizen who had grown up in the Buffalo suburb of
Lackawanna, New York, emigrated with his family to Saudi Arabia, and
returned to Lackawanna in the late 1990s. He later recruited half a dozen
other American Muslims to travel to Afghanistan, where they took part in
an al-Qaeda training camp in 2001, months before the attack on 9/11.
   It would be a milestone of sorts for the NSA--its first assassination.
But it would not be the last. The agency created to passively eavesdrop on
targets was now, with the CIA, actively assassinating targets. On January
13, 2006, for example, the NSA likely assisted the CIA in attempting to
assassinate Ayman al-Zawahiri, bin Laden's deputy. Unfortunately, the
missiles missed Zawahiri and instead killed as many as eighteen civil-
ians, many of them women and children, triggering protests throughout
Pakistan.
   Assassinations carried out by intelligence employees had long been
outlawed--by Presidents Ford, in 1976, and Reagan, in 1981. Also, a UN
report concerning the 2002 Yemen killing called the strike "an alarming


                                       136

                               A S S A S S I N A T I O N

precedent [and] a clear case of extrajudicial killing" in violation of inter-
national laws and treaties. But as he did with the warrantless eavesdrop-
ping program, Bush brushed aside the law and instead claimed that the
authorization to kill suspected terrorists was vested in him under congres-
sional war powers following the 9/11 attacks.
   By the time of the assassination, Hayden was well aware that war with
Iraq was only months away, and he put his agency's workforce on notice
that they should be planning accordingly and not waiting for the bombs
to start falling. Speaking on the NSA's Top Secret/Codeword internal
television show, Talk NSA, he said, "A Sigint agency can't wait for the
political decision." He later told several subordinates, "It is my judgment
in doing this for [more than] thirty years, I have never seen a condition
like this when it didn't end in war. We're going to war."
   In preparation, Hayden had the agency conduct what he called a "Rock
Drill," a term taken from old army exercises where rocks--signifying
fortifications--were moved around on a map. In an agency more famil-
iar with routers than rocks, the exercise focused mostly on "hearabil-
ity"--where best to place remote sensors to pick up communications. At
another point, Hayden had his graphics department produce a stoplight
chart indicating the agency's capabilities against various Iraqi targets.
While much of northern and southern Iraq, where the U.S. had long been
patrolling no-fly zones, was colored green, the Republican Guard was
yellow--barely--and Saddam Hussein and his senior political and mili-
tary leaders glowed bright red.
   But a key problem for the NSA in launching a war against Iraq, accord-
ing to the former NSA director William O. Studeman, a navy vice admi-
ral, was that the U.S. had already let Saddam Hussein know many of its
secrets during the Iran-Iraq war. "Having had about four years' or more
worth of U.S. delivering intelligence to it with regard to Iran's conduct of
the war, Iraq had a substantial knowledge and sensitivity of our capabili-
ties in the area of imaging and other intelligence collection methods such
as signals intelligence. If you go back to the fundamental principles of
intelligence, we had already failed on the first count. That is, our security
had been penetrated because we were dealing with this target to whom
we had spent so many years displaying what our intelligence capabilities
were. Add the fact that Iraq is a very secretive country itself and places a
great premium on security, and you then have a target that is probably the


                                        137

                           B O O K T W O : T A R G E T S

most denial-and-deception-oriented target that the U.S. has ever faced. It
is a country that goes out of its way to create a large number of barriers to
allowing any Western penetration of its capabilities and intentions."
   With the war in Iraq approaching, the tension and stress levels at the
Middle East listening post mounted. Kinne had been opposed to the war
from the beginning, but Berry was gung ho in favor of it and volunteered
for a second year at NSA Georgia. "I agreed to stay army because I'm
as angry as any affected New Yorker about the murder of about 3,000
innocents on September 11, 2001," he said. "Plus, because I'm an intel-
ligence officer, I'm in a great position to avenge the holocaust I saw on
TV that day." "He bought everything," said Kinne. "He thought Iraq was
connected to 9/11."
   As Kinne eavesdropped on Inmarsat communications, another group
focused on a new competitor, an Arab communications satellite called
Thuraya. Built by Boeing Satellite Systems and launched into orbit in
October 2000, the satellite featured the world's most powerful satellite
digital communications processor. The heart and brain of the spacecraft,
the processor was a product of both Boeing and IBM technology and en-
abled the spacecraft to handle up to tens of thousands of wireless phone
calls simultaneously throughout the Middle East. Owned by Thuraya
Satellite Telecommunications Co. Ltd., based in the United Arab Emir-
ates, the satellite system was marketed aggressively in an attempt to both
draw customers away from Inmarsat and create a regional demand for
their small, blue handheld phones. The campaign worked well and within
a few years there were more than 65,000 of the company's phones in use
and the minutes used per day were double the company's expectations.
   Thuraya's satellite quickly became a key target of the NSA. Soon after
the September 11 attacks, in a major change, Hayden ordered that deter-
mining the location of callers and receivers suspected of involvement in
terrorism be placed on a higher priority status than deciphering and trans-
lating the actual conversations. This was a result of the continuing diffi-
culty in acquiring adequate numbers of competent translators, an inability
to decipher many of their targets' homemade verbal codes, and the need
to quickly capture--or kill--suspected terrorists. Another factor was the
growing use of encryption and the NSA's inability, without spending ex-
cessive amounts of computer time and human energy, to solve commer-
cial systems more complex than 256 bits.


                                      138

                               A S S A S S I N A T I O N

   Fortunately for the NSA, among the people who communicated with
the small blue phones, which could also be used for terrestrial mobile
calls, were senior Iraqi officials. A key advantage for the spy agency was
the fact that the phones contained Global Positioning System (GPS) chips
that revealed their coordinates to the NSA. At Fort Meade, as the Bush
administration began moving closer to its invasion of Baghdad, analysts
studying intercepted Iraqi conversations were making progress. They
successfully matched some of the phones to a number of senior officials
and, at various times, were able to determine their locations within a
broad geographic area. It was part of a plan to decapitate the Iraqi leader-
ship at the start of the war.
   But despite the NSA's enormous capabilities, as the rush to war began
gathering steam, most of the intelligence that the NSA was able to pick
up was ambiguous and far from solid with regard to weapons of mass de-
struction. "When I asked our best analysts to characterize our Sigint now,
in comparison to the Humint [human intelligence], as an overall assess-
ment, they characterized the Sigint as either ambiguous or confirmatory
of the Humint," said Hayden. At the time, however, there was very little
Humint. Adding to the ambiguity problem was the fact that much of the
equipment that Hussein was receiving and the U.S. was monitoring was
dual-use--items that could be used for either innocent or nefarious pur-
poses. Hayden's Sigint analysts, he said, "brought up an additional fact
that made this hard. Saddam was living under a sanction regime. Most
commercial transactions which in other parts of the world would have
been legitimate transactions were in many cases in Iraq violations of the
sanctions. So an awful lot of commercial transactions were of an am-
biguous nature that involved dual-use materials or dual-use equipment."
   These transactions, said Hayden, "were conducted in an almost clan-
destine sort of way. Now, how do you distinguish that clandestinity as
evidence of pursuing WMD, as opposed to simply a reflection of living
under a regime in which commercial transactions that otherwise would
be viewed as normal here have to be conducted in a secretive sort of
way? . . . When you're looking at the evidence here, say you're a Siginter
[a signals intelligence analyst] and you're looking at an intercept. It's
admittedly ambiguous--you may give country X the benefit of the doubt,
but if country X is Iraq, this is a guy who you know has lied about his




                                        139

                            B O O K T W O : T A R G E T S

weapons of mass destruction program, so there's a tendency here to be
suspicious about even ambiguous activity."
   Despite the doubts, Hayden raised no objections to the preparations
for war and on January 13, he brought several hundred of the agency's
senior managers together in the Friedman Auditorium for a highly secret
"town meeting." Concerned about the criticism the agency received dur-
ing the first Gulf War that valuable Sigint was never distributed beyond
Washington, Hayden said this time that wouldn't happen. This time, he
said, there needed to be a much greater effort to get key intelligence im-
mediately to the soldiers on the front line, where it could then be acted
upon immediately.
   Then Hayden issued a formal "Statement of Director's Intent" for the
war. "If directed," it said in part, "I intend to conduct a Sigint . . . opera-
tion that will meet the combatant commanders' objective of shock, speed,
and awe while also providing policy makers information that is action-
able and timely . . . We will push intelligence to those places it needs to
be. I expect leaders at every level to actively remove obstacles to dissemi-
nation." One method of moving the Sigint immediately to the battlefield
was through a new instant messaging system code-named Zircon.
   Next Hayden turned his attention, and his agency's giant ears, to-
ward the United Nations. Three months earlier, the Bush administration
won support for its war from both houses of Congress. With the country
largely convinced, Bush reluctantly went along with Secretary of State
Colin Powell's recommendation to convince the rest of the world through
a United Nations resolution authorizing the use of force against Iraq. As
the vote on the resolution approached, Hayden intensified his eavesdrop-
ping on the UN, and especially Secretary-General Kofi Annan and the
Security Council.
   According to Annan's predecessor, Boutros Boutros-Ghali, "From the
first day I entered my office they said, `Beware, your office is bugged,
your residence is bugged, and it is a tradition that the member states who
have the technical capacity to bug will do it without any hesitation.' That
would involve members of the Security Council. The perception is that
you must know in advance that your office, your residence, your car, your
phone is bugged."
   In England, Member of Parliament Claire Short, a former member of
Prime Minister Tony Blair's cabinet, set off a storm when she admitted


                                       140

                              A S S A S S I N A T I O N

that in the weeks prior to the launch of the Iraq war she had read secret
transcripts of UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan's confidential conversa-
tions. The transcripts were likely made by the NSA and shared with its
sister British eavesdropping agency, GCHQ, which passed them on to the
prime minister's office.
   "The UK in this time was also spying on Kofi Annan's office and get-
ting reports from him about what was going on," said Short. She added,
"These things are done. And in the case of Kofi's office, it's been done
for some time . . . I have seen transcripts of Kofi Annan's conversations.
In fact, I have had conversations with Kofi in the run-up to war, thinking,
`Oh dear, there will be a transcript of this and people will see what he and
I are saying.' "
   NSA was also eavesdropping intensely on the undecided members of
the UN Security Council. On November 8, 2002, the members passed
Resolution 1441, warning of "serious consequences" if Iraq did not take a
"final opportunity to comply with its disarmament obligations." To Wash-
ington, that translated into an authorization to launch its war against Iraq
if they failed to comply fully, but London disagreed. With a population
far less supportive of military action against Iraq, Prime Minister Tony
Blair's government suggested that a second resolution, specifically autho-
rizing war, would be required before the launch of an all-out UN-backed
invasion. Reluctantly, primarily as a favor to his friend Blair, Bush agreed
to the recommendation.
   By late January the Bush and Blair administrations had determined
that Iraq had failed to fully disarm and as a result they were putting tre-
mendous pressure on the uncommitted members of the Security Council
to vote in favor of its tough go-to-war resolution. On the other side, argu-
ing against the war, were France, Germany, and Russia. Thus the "Middle
Six" on the Council, as they became known--Angola, Cameroon, Chile,
Mexico, Guinea, and Pakistan--suddenly became top candidates for
America's friendship, and key targets for the NSA's eavesdropping.
   The NSA was like a cheat at a poker game; knowing what cards were in
other players' hands would give the United States a critical advantage. By
listening in as the delegates communicated back to their home countries,
the NSA would be able to discover which way they might vote, which
positions they favored or opposed, and what their negotiating positions
would be. The agency also could pick up indications of what they needed,


                                       141

                             B O O K T W O : T A R G E T S

such as a highway, a dam, or a favorable trade deal, and, in a subtle form
of bribery, the U.S. could provide the country with a generous "aid pack-
age" to help pay for the construction.
   Among the things that the NSA tapped into was a secret meeting of the
Middle Six, who were seeking, in a last-ditch effort, to come up with a com-
promise resolution to avert the war in Iraq by giving the weapons inspectors
more time to finish their work. According to former Mexican ambassador
to the UN Adolfo Aguilar Zinser, the Americans somehow learned of the
meeting and intervened. They could only have learned of the plan, said Zin-
ser, as a result of electronic surveillance. As soon as the Americans found
out about the meeting, Zinser claimed, "they said, `You should know that
we don't like the idea and we don't like you to promote it.' "
   Having already won over the U.S. Congress and the American public,
the Bush administration was not about to let a half dozen Third World
countries get between them and their war. Thus, on January 31, the
NSA ratcheted up its targeting of the Middle Six. Frank Koza, the Sigint
department's deputy chief of staff for Regional Targets, sent a Top Se-
cret/Codeword memo to the NSA's Five Eyes partners in Britain, Canada,
Australia, and New Zealand asking for help:


   As you've likely heard by now, the Agency is mounting a surge
   particularly directed at the UN Security Council (UNSC) members
   (minus US and GBR [Great Britain] of course) for insights as to
   how membership is reacting to the on-going debate RE: Iraq, plans
   to vote on any related resolutions, what related policies/negotiating
   positions they may be considering, alliances/dependencies, etc.--
   the whole gamut of information that could give US policymakers
   an edge in obtaining results favorable to US goals or to head off
   surprises.


   Koza added, "I suspect that you'll be hearing more along these lines in
formal channels--especially as this effort will probably peak (at least for
this specific focus) in the middle of next week, following the SecState's
[Secretary of State Colin Powell's] presentation to the UNSC." It was
during that address by Powell that the Bush administration would make
its last major argument before launching the war--and the NSA was to
play a leading role in the presentation.

L  ike Hollywood producers, the White House Iraq Group (WHIG) was
   looking for a media spectacular to sell not just the American public
but the rest of the skeptical world on the need to go to war with Iraq. The
answer was to replay the scene from the 1962 Cuban missile crisis when
Kennedy administration UN ambassador Adlai Stevenson went on televi-
sion to confront his Soviet counterpart in the Security Council over ballis-
tic missiles in Cuba. While the whole world watched, Stevenson proved
the Russians were hiding weapons of mass destruction on Castro's island.
Four decades later, the role of Stevenson would be played by Secretary of
State Colin Powell, backed up by a twenty-first-century sound and light
show. As probably the most widely trusted member of the Bush adminis-
tration, Powell would be the perfect choice and the Security Council the
ideal venue to sell the WHIG's spurious claims against Iraq.
   On February 5, 2003, Powell took his seat at the round Security Coun-
cil table and made his case to the world. It was a powerful and convinc-
ing performance, particularly because of his assertive language and lack
of qualifiers. "My colleagues," he said, "every statement I make today
is backed up by sources, solid sources. These are not assertions. What
we're giving you are facts and conclusions based on solid intelligence."
He began with what he likely thought would be the most dramatic and
convincing evidence--by playing actual NSA intercepts of Iraq military
personnel.
  "What you're about to hear is a conversation that my government mon-


                                    143

                             B O O K T W O : T A R G E T S

itored. It takes place on November 26 of last year, on the day before
United Nations teams resumed inspections in Iraq. The conversation in-
volves two senior officers, a colonel and a brigadier general, from Iraq's
elite military unit, the Republican Guard." On the first intercept, the colo-
nel says, "We have this modified vehicle . . . What do we say if one of
them sees it?" He notes that it is from the al-Kindi company. "Yeah, yeah.
I'll come to you in the morning. I have some comments. I'm worried you
all have something left."
   A second intercept, recorded on January 30, 2003, involves a conversa-
tion between Republican Guard headquarters and an officer in the field.
"There is a directive of the [Republican] Guard chief of staff at the con-
ference today," says headquarters. "They are inspecting the ammunition
you have . . . for the possibility there are forbidden ammo . . . We sent
you a message yesterday to clean out all of the areas, the scrap areas, the
abandoned areas. Make sure there is nothing there . . . After you have
carried out what is contained in the message, destroy the message." The
officer agrees.
   And a third intercept, said Powell, "shows a captain in the Second
Corps of the Republican Guard being ordered by a colonel to `remove the
expression "nerve agents" from wireless instructions.' "
   In years of monitoring Iraqi communications, that was the best the
NSA had--comments about a "modified vehicle," an order to get rid of
some "forbidden ammo," and an order to "remove the expression `nerve
agents' from wireless instructions." Even NSA director Hayden agreed
that they were little more than ambiguous. "We were asked, what do you
have," said Hayden in an interview. "And we surfaced several, including
these three . . . If you take a textual analysis of that, they are ambiguous.
That said, you don't have to be a dishonest or intellectually handicapped
person to be very suspicious about when the guy's saying remove all
references to this from your codebooks, or the other guy saying `I've got
one of the modified vehicles here.' "
   Asked "Modified in what way?" Hayden said, "Well, we don't know.
That's the ambiguity. So we went ahead and played them . . . In my heart,
each one of them individually could be explained away as this, that, or
the other. Collectively they made a reasonably good package . . . Now
you say they're ambiguous. And I admit that, yeah, I can intellectualize
and you can explain away some of these things . . . For example, let's


                                        144

                                     W A R

just take the one about removing all references to `nerve agents' in your
codebooks. If I'm innocent and I'm on the other side of the fence [I might
say,] `Oh, give me a break, for God's sake, we all have codebooks, we
all need references in it; you tell me you don't have codewords for nerve
agents on the battlefield. All modern armies have those codewords, you
idiots.' "
   In fact, given the obvious ambiguity of the intercepts, Hayden was
surprised that the Iraqis did not argue that case more strongly. "They
didn't do that. What they said was, these are third-class forgeries that
any high school student can fabricate. That was very interesting to me,
because rather than taking the textual criticism and attacking [the inter-
cepts] on their merits, or lack of merit, they dismissed them as forgeries.
I just looked at it and said, `Well, why are you going down that track?' It
lessened the sense of ambiguity. Whatever lingering sense of ambiguity
about these intercepts was in my mind got lessened by the Iraqi govern-
ment's response to it."
   Even within Powell's small task force, the NSA intercepts--the most
dramatic evidence they had--was looked upon as ambiguous. "If Captain
Hindi with a Republican Guard unit was saying, `Take nerve agents out
of his CEOI--out of his communicating instructions,' " said a senior of-
ficial, "that could have a double meaning. I mean, we took it as having
a meaning that they didn't want the inspectors to know they had nerve
agents. But it could be the other side of the coin, too--they got rid of
them, so they're taking it out of the CEOI because they don't need it
anymore."
   But the public was never told how weak and ambiguous the best evi-
dence was. They would be told the opposite. In addition to hearing the
intercepts, Powell brought up the frightening topic of biological weapons.
"Saddam Hussein has investigated dozens of biological agents, causing
diseases such as gas gangrene, plague, typhus, tetanus, cholera, camel
pox, and hemorrhagic fever. And he also has the wherewithal to de-
velop smallpox." Then he warned, "One of the most worrisome things
that emerges from the thick intelligence file we have on Iraq's biological
weapons is the existence of mobile production facilities used to make
biological agents."
   Finally, at 3:15 a.m. on March 20, 2003, an iron rain began to fall over
Baghdad and the first of 29,199 bombs plunged toward earth. The Bush


                                     145

                             B O O K T W O : T A R G E T S

administration would call it "shock and awe." Six thousand miles away,
the friction between Kinne and Berry continued as they listened to the
bombs explode. "During shock and awe he [Berry] said, `We're going to
bomb those barbarians back to kingdom come,' " said Kinne. Berry then
sent an e-mail to everyone in the Highlander unit in which he meant to
write, "We're going to hit them with a fury of bombs during shock and
awe." But he ended up saying "furry" instead of "fury." "It was hilarious,"
said Kinne.
   Sitting at her station, Kinne was listening to several American NGO aid
workers trying to get to safety and giving their position every few minutes
to their headquarters. "That night, around the time of the initial invasion,
I heard two Americans traveling somewhere in the region and they kept
calling their main office because they were checking in and so they kept
giving them updates on their location because they were kind of afraid.
So I was monitoring them because I . . . would send out KL [high priority
"Klieg Light"] reports updating their location--to whoever our consumers
were." Kinne hoped the reports might warn of an attack in their area.
  About the same time, an intercepted fax came in from the Iraqi Na-
tional Congress, a group led by the Iraqi dissident Ahmed Chalabi. Close
to the neoconservatives in the Bush administration, he had been pressing
the U.S. government for years to launch a war against Iraq so he could
replace Saddam Hussein as the country's leader. It was later discovered
that much of his "evidence" that Hussein had weapons of mass destruc-
tion was fraudulent. "The fax came in, the analyst printed it off, gave it to
me, I looked at it, and I could see that it said something about missiles,"
Kinne said.
   Focusing on the two lost Americans, Kinne ignored the fax. "Part of
me said that if we were going to be monitoring Americans, then if they
need help that I was going to make sure I did whatever I could to see to
that. So at the end of shift I told the people who were coming on mids
[midnight shift]--that was around eleven o'clock at night--that these
people were calling in, they were calling in every fifteen, twenty minutes
for a while. And I also told them there was this fax. Well, they didn't get
to the fax, and it wasn't till the next day on the day shift that somebody
started translating the fax."
   It turned out that the fax contained more allegations by Chalabi about
supposed locations for weapons of mass destruction--information that


                                        146

                                     W A R

should have been sent out immediately as a CRITIC, the NSA's high-
est-priority message, designed to reach the president's desk within five
minutes. "So we all get called in because they realize the nature of what
the fax was," said Kinne, "where all the weapons of mass destruction
in Iraq were. This . . . got sent via CRITIC to the White House." In her
defense, Kinne pointed out Chalabi's lack of credibility. "I made a point
of saying to Mr. Berry, `Just because this is all written down in a fax does
not mean it's true. Why are we acting as if it's black and white and this
is actually reflective of reality?' And that's when he said, `You're not an
analyst, you're an interceptor, and it's not your job to decide whether or
not the intelligence is accurate, it's your job to collect.' "
   Kinne later thought the entire incident was very suspicious. "It's really
weird," she said, "because the fax--we had a lot of faxes that came in and
we only had so many linguists so we didn't always get to faxes and a lot
of times they would come and go and nobody ever said anything." The
Chalabi message, she said, was the first time "where somebody called
them and asked them what was going on with the fax . . . It was some-
how called to the attention of people and [they were] asked where's this
fax? Now I almost wonder if our government was telling the INC how to
frigging pass information so we could intercept it . . . I just don't doubt
that they could have done it intentionally just to get propaganda in the
military . . . So when I got out of the military, and sometime in the begin-
ning of 2004, I think I was at the gym and I was reading a Newsweek or
U.S. News and World Report or something and there was a little blurb
in there that said that we had determined that the INC had been feeding
us misinformation about Iraq, and I just immediately thought about the
CRITIC, and immediately your blood goes cold and you realize that it
was all a bunch of bullshit."
   That same night, Kinne discovered that among the locations on the
military's target list during shock and awe was the Palestine Hotel in
Baghdad, the main residence for journalists covering the war. As she
eavesdropped, she could hear the frightened journalists calling home or
calling in stories to their editors back in the States and thought someone
should tell the military to avoid bombing the location. "During shock and
awe," said Kinne, the journalists in the hotel were "calling family mem-
bers in the States or even their employers or coworkers and talking about,
just the fact that they were really concerned for their safety. And I don't


                                     147

                             B O O K T W O : T A R G E T S

even remember why we would have been given a potential target list but
I just remember seeing the Palestine Hotel listed, and I knew there were
journalists staying at the Palestine Hotel that thought they were safe. I
went to Mr. Berry and said there are journalists staying there, they think
they're safe, but it's a potential target, shouldn't somebody do something
or say something? And he just kind of blew me off. He said somebody
else, further up the chain, knows what they're doing."
   At another point, Kinne was eavesdropping on a conversation between
American and British aid workers. "The Brit, clear as day, said, `Be care-
ful because the Americans are listening.' And the American said, `No,
they're not; I'm protected by USSID 18; they can't spy on me; I'm an
American.' That set off all the red alarms and people just went ape," call-
ing it a major breach of security because uncleared civilians were not
supposed to know about the NSA document.
   Without any intelligence agents on the ground at the start of the conflict,
the military was forced to rely on the NSA to locate members of Saddam
Hussein's regime. But the agency had already found that Thuraya's GPS
system was only accurate within a one-hundred-meter radius--more than
three football fields. Thus the geo-location of the caller could be any-
where within a vast 31,400-square-meter area, much of it densely packed
urban neighborhoods. This meant that killing Iraqi officials with Toma-
hawk cruise missiles and two-thousand-pound penetrator bombs was less
a matter of precision targeting and more like firing blindly into very large
crowds. While the weapons landed exactly where they were supposed
to, not a single senior Iraqi official was hit--a 100 percent failure rate.
Instead, large numbers of Iraqi civilians were killed.
   While almost everything Operation Highlander received was unen-
crypted, Kinne did occasionally intercept a voice message that was sim-
ply a person reading a long series of coded letters and numbers. "At some
point we started getting code, picking up conversations that were just
code," she said. Those messages had to be sent to NSA headquarters for
deciphering. "They wouldn't send us the key, so we weren't allowed to
translate them ourselves or break the code. The mission before, in '96,
they gave our analysts the key so they could break it themselves." One of
those alphanumeric messages sent to the NSA was eventually returned,
and Kinne was surprised by what it revealed. "One of the codes was Sad-
dam Hussein's location. We collected it before he was captured, but they


                                        148

                                     W A R

didn't tell us what the code broke out to until after he was captured. So I
have no idea if that location was at all instrumental in his actual capture."
   After Kinne intercepted calls, another group nearby used the phone
numbers to create large charts in an attempt to find hidden links between
them, a technique known as "call chaining analysis." "They would go
through and they would do telephone diagrams of who was calling which
numbers and kind of do these huge elaborate Inmarsat telephone dia-
grams," said Kinne. To do the call chaining, the analysts use a program
known as PatternTracer, made by i2 Inc., a company in McLean, Virginia.
"When suspected terrorists go to great lengths to disguise their call activity,
PatternTracer can be used to find hidden connections in volumes of call
record data," says the company.
   In addition to PatternTracer, the analysts at NSA Georgia have an al-
phabet soup of data mining, traffic analysis, and social network analy-
sis tools--secret and unclassified--within their computers. They include
Agility, AMHS, Anchory, ArcView, Fastscope, Hightide, Hombase, In-
telink, Octave, Document Management Center, Dishfire, CREST, Pinwale,
COASTLINE, SNACKS, Cadence, Gamut, Mainway, Marina, Osis, Puz-
zlecube, Surrey, Tuningfork, Xkeyscore, and Unified Tasking Tool. The
NSA also maintains large databases containing the address information,
known as externals, on millions of intercepted messages, such as the Ex-
ternals Data Global Exploitation (EDGE) database, the Communication
External Notation list, and the Communications Externals Data Reposi-
tory and Integration Center.
   Kinne saw little in the way of major accomplishments by the High-
lander operation. "I think I have some sense that we did get one al-Qaeda
network over the course of the time, but I don't, I'm not really as familiar
with that," she said. In her entire time there, the only CRITIC message
sent out was the one from Chalabi; none were issued concerning terror-
ism or al-Qaeda.
  "I am greatly fearful of what has been happening with our country, and
our Constitution," concluded Kinne. "And I just kind of saw in those two
years of service how things drastically and dramatically changed for the
worse. Part of me will always regret not having upheld my oath of mili-
tary service to the fullest extent that I should have. You know as a soldier
we take an oath to defend the Constitution against all enemies foreign
and domestic."

   In Iraq, following the collapse of the government and the start of the
American occupation, the NSA set up a large antenna farm within the
Green Zone. Although there is no name on the compound, its nickname is
Camp Alec, apparently derived from the CIA's bin Laden unit. About one
hundred yards long and fifty yards wide, the facility consisted of four sin-
gle-story buildings with double, bomb-proof roofs and a high tower con-
taining a number of microwave horns and high-frequency antennas. Also
within the compound, which was surrounded by two high steel fences,
were a pair of medium-sized satellite dishes. The entire compound was
part of an overall NSA security program code-named Viper.
   The key targets were the thousands of cell phones within Baghdad and
the surrounding areas, many of which were used by the growing numbers
of insurgents as they planted roadside bombs. Once the intercepts were
captured by the antennas, they were zapped into one of the four window-
less buildings. "Where the information goes is a bank of computers," said
one person who worked at the site. "We were under mortar attack there
quite a bit." The data would then be transmitted both to the NSA's head-
quarters within the Green Zone, co-located with the CIA's offices, and
also to NSA Georgia, where most of the analysis would take place. Ac-
cording to the source, "The data collected provides the Joint Special Op-
erations Command with about 75 percent of the actionable intelligence
that they're using to hit sites in Iraq."
  "You would transcribe it word for word and then after the word melon
you put a little `op comment' in, to the effect that `in terms of voice in-
flection it does not seem this guy is truly talking about melons.' It comes
down to inflection, a lot of gut reaction to things," said Faulk. "The prob-
lem is, we never really got good feedback, post-mission feedback, about
whether the targeted people were actually truly guilty of terrorist acts.
After the house was blown up, did you indeed find weapons and bombs in
it? You get these guys calling between one another using cover terms and
speaking around issues. So you always run the risk that you'll kill some
innocent people who really are selling melons and not IEDs. There's a
guy going with a truck of melons somewhere and someone has to make
the call--this is what really is kind of heart-wrenching about the thing--
somebody has to make the call whether the guy moving melons is really
moving melons or not. And you get a guy eight thousand miles away in
a cubicle and he's supposed to know these things. It left me thinking we


                                        150

                                    W A R

killed a lot of innocent people, but I have no real way of knowing . . . A
lot of people don't really care about that . . . And that was one of the rea-
sons I got out--to actually have to do that and know that people are going
to live or die based on that is something I just can't live with. It's not the
kind of mistake I want to make."
   Despite the importance of Iraq to the Bush administration, few senior
NSA officials ever left the comfort of their eighth-floor suite of offices
and visited the war zone. One exception was Eric Haseltine, the iconoclas-
tic former Disney imagineer who was brought aboard as assistant direc-
tor for research to shake up the agency's institutional thinking. "Hayden
wanted to really get an out-of-the-box person in there," said Haseltine,
"so he got a headhunter to find a really out-of-the-box person, and I guess
he figured he couldn't get more out-of-the-box than Disney."
   It was an odd mix at the start, but Haseltine quickly fit it. "I was told
that I was an alien," he said. "In some ways I fit in because I was a geek
and it's an agency of geeks--you're either a linguist geek or a math or
computer geek; and so one geek will resonate with another geek." He
quickly earned his geek credentials when during a meeting he mentioned,
"Cherenkov radiation is inherently vectorized so that you have an accep-
tance cone." According to Haseltine, "When I said vectorized Cherenkov
radiation, I was a geek--I wasn't just a suit."
   Haseltine found a wide gap in the cultures at the CIA and the NSA.
"CIA is a very people-oriented place. It's a comfortable place to be--they
have fabrics from around the world and objets d'art--it's a people-friendly
place. NSA is a machine-friendly place. It's raised floors and converging
lines of parallax down naked hallways forever. You tend to get a lot more
extroverts at CIA who are good salesmen. At CIA you have people who
are street smart, and at NSA you have people who are think smart." And
because of the way technology was dominating most aspects of life today,
"the future was pushing most intelligence missions toward Fort Meade."
  "If you're talking about Russia, Humint is really important," said Hasel-
tine. "If you're talking about al-Qaeda, Humint ought to be important, but
Sigint turns out to be more important. If I'm a terrorist in Syria and wanted
to communicate with a terrorist in Tehran and I'm using AOL or Hotmail,
my conversation would go through Reston, Virginia, or Seattle. Geog-
raphy is dead. We may have physical borders, but cyberspace does not
recognize them." Eavesdropping, he said, is not the issue; the difficulty for


                                    151

                             B O O K T W O : T A R G E T S

the NSA is sorting through it all. "Our ability to collect stuff far outstrips
our ability to understand what we collect--and that is the central problem,
that is the core problem. What's probably surprising to most people--you
know they think, how do we tap this cable or have a big antenna and scoop
up these transmissions--that is so much not the problem."
   Soon after he arrived, Haseltine was on a plane to Baghdad to view the
agency from the perspective of the battlefield. "The wars we are in today
are intelligence wars," he said. "And so if you believe that Sigint is num-
ber one, then the syllogism says NSA becomes the most important part of
the war." He was surprised by what he found. "I spent a lot of time in Iraq.
I went there three times when I was at NSA. The second time I came back
from Iraq, I sat down with General Hayden and I said, `Sir, there's good
news and there's bad news. At corps [level] and above, everybody loves
you. At division and below, they hate you like you wouldn't believe.' He
had never heard that before from anybody. And the reason is there was no
NSA presence below corps. The NSA information went down to a certain
level and stopped. So the stuff that comes in at the top doesn't percolate
down to the bottom."
   Haseltine, who at the time was equal to a two-star general, received a
shock on his first trip to the war zone. "I sat down in a lieutenant colonel's
office in Baghdad who was in charge of intelligence for that division," he
recalled. "And I said, `Colonel, I'm here to help you help me help you.'
And he said, `Get the fuck out of my office.' I said I'll get out, but first tell
me why. He said you're a mucky muck at NSA; you guys are such ass-
holes. He knows I'm the associate director of the agency--he didn't care.
He said, `You guys are the huge rusty gear, and we're the fast gear--and
there's no way your gears are going to engage in our gears and help us.'
He says get out of here. You're just big and slow and bureaucratic. NSA
had a very bad reputation below the senior levels because they never saw
value from it. And it wasn't necessarily NSA's fault. That's the interesting
thing. Was it the NSA's fault that the army chose not to share information
down below the top echelon? But NSA got blamed for it." They didn't
hate Hayden; they hated the NSA.
   One of the colonel's major complaints was that he wanted the NSA
to send him copies of the raw, untranslated, and unanalyzed intercepts,
something the agency very rarely does. "They wanted the raw data," said
Haseltine. "They said, `Hey, you've collected some, you give it to us,


                                        152

                                    W A R

we'll do the analysis.' Here's a couple of things he didn't understand.
What if we gave you the raw transcripts in some dialect of Arabic? How
many Arabic linguists do you have? Your worst nightmare would be if
we gave you our whole collection. They didn't understand at least two
things. One is that there is just unbelievable amounts of information--
they would never have a prayer of finding their way through it. Number
two, do they have the analysts to chomp on it? No way. Number three,
there are legitimate legal issues involved."
   Rather than give them the data, Hayden decided to assign an agency
analyst to the division--it was a procedure the agency began repeating
throughout government. "The bottom line is if you wanted to help some-
body, you couldn't give them data, you had to give them a person, you
had to give them a human body, because that person knew how to cope
with information, and that person had the authority to give the informa-
tion. So in my mind, NSA was transforming more from a product busi-
ness to a service business. That was a paradigm shift that was going on,
and I think I did help accelerate that with my conversations with General
Hayden."
   Despite his progress in integrating the NSA into the front lines,
Haseltine made few friends and many enemies with this unorthodox
approach. At a very senior meeting, the deputy director of a large in-
telligence agency--he wouldn't say whether it was the NSA or not--
told him: "You know, Haseltine, you've got a bad reputation," he said.
"You're a subcabinet-level official and you go out talking to sergeants
in Iraq. You short-circuit way too many chains of command to ever get
our cooperation."
  With the U.S. in charge of rewiring Iraq's entire communications in-
frastructure, the NSA had a unique opportunity to turn the entire country
into one giant acoustic bug. By 2008, over $1 billion in U.S. and Iraqi
reconstruction funds and approximately $6 billion in private-sector in-
vestment had been spent on developing the national telecom architecture.
This included six buried fiber-optic loops and a microwave network run-
ning north to south from Dohuk to Basra and west to east from the Jorda-
nian border through Baghdad to Diyala Province and onward to Kirkuk
and Sulaimaniya. Contracts were also given to interconnect the country
with both FLAG Falcon and FOG 2 undersea cable systems. "What can
be more important for Iraq today than a modern communications infra-


                                    153

                            B O O K T W O : T A R G E T S

structure?" said Minister of Communications Mohammed Tawfiq Allawi.
"It is the technology thread that weaves our country together."
   Yet despite this opportunity, more than five years after the war began
the NSA may be as deaf to the actions of the Iraqi government as when
Saddam Hussein was in power. For example, when Iraqi prime minister
Nuri Kamal al-Maliki launched his military attack on the radical anti-
American cleric Moktada al-Sadr's forces in Basra in March 2008, the
CIA, the White House, and the commanders on the ground in Iraq were
all caught completely by surprise. "You didn't know it was going to hap-
pen?" asked host Tim Russert on NBC's Meet the Press. "No more so
than Dave Petraeus or Ambassador Crocker did," said Hayden, now the
director of the CIA.
   Among the highest priority intelligence operations within Iraq was the
effort to locate computers used by the government of Saddam Hussein,
remove the hard drives, and then send the drives to the CIA and NSA
for forensic examination, translation, and analysis. The hope was to find
either the locations where the weapons of mass destruction were suppos-
edly hidden or Saddam Hussein's hideout. But with few capable Arabic
linguists available and an equally scarce number of highly cleared com-
puter experts, the operation produced a great deal of chaos and confusion
but very little actionable intelligence. As a result, the CIA began paying
out millions of dollars to scores of private companies, both long-estab-
lished giants and small start-ups. Nicknamed "beltway bandits" because
many had offices around the Interstate 495 beltway circling Washington,
these contractors would recruit current and former CIA and NSA em-
ployees at up to double their salaries.
    Once on board, they were frequently assigned back to the same offices
at CIA and NSA doing the same work, but now the taxpayers were paying
them up to twice as much. Others were assigned even less sophisticated
work than they were originally performing. Because of the slapdash na-
ture of the rush to expand, the quality of intelligence produced by some
of those contractors quickly became questionable. "The money is incred-
ible--I doubled my salary to go out and come back in and continue doing
what I was doing," said one former CIA official who had been assigned
to the Directorate of Operations (DO), now called the National Clandes-
tine Service. "They're all former DO officers, and basically what these
companies are doing, they have this net, and all these people trickling out


                                       154

                                      W A R

of the agency, they're just catching them. It's like fruit on the ground, be-
cause the agency doesn't have the people that they need to do these jobs.
But the problem is these jobs are mindless--because once again there's
no structure applied to the task at hand. So we're all just sitting there
looking at each other, and we're making a ridiculous amount of money."
   According to one senior intelligence official, "The DO's chunk of the
budget inside the CIA is now bigger than the entire CIA budget was when
Bush came to office. Nobody can tell you [whether] what you're getting
is any good or not. They're paying so much money to third-party coun-
tries for stuff, it's incredible. I don't think anybody even knows, really,
how much money we're giving Pakistan."
   Because much of the data in the hard drives was in Arabic or other lan-
guages that few analysts read or spoke, often the information simply col-
lected dust. "The first contract I was on I left, because I said this is fraud,"
said a CIA officer turned contractor. "There was over a million dollars
sitting in that [CIA] office--just the [contractor] salary we collected, not
to mention the extra money that goes to these companies. We sat there
all day and same-timed each other, which is like instant messaging. We
would just same-time each other all day. And after about three months of
that, I went to my company and I said you need to get me off this contract
or I'm going to another company or I'm leaving altogether. Basically
what we were doing," he said, "is we were looking for any ops leads in
these hard drives--through e-mail--things that were found residually on
hard drives. Anything you do in the computer is somewhere engraved in
a hard drive, and so we could look for tools to mine . . . Sometimes we
got hard drives that were probably a couple of weeks old, because these
are hard drives from where we went out and either rendered people or we
raided places and we would just scoop up--not we, but the agents who
were out there--the military would just scoop up hard drives in a big old
Santa Claus bag and send them back."
   The problem came when the information was not in English, which
was most of the time. According to the contractor:


   A lot of it was in Arabic, and none of us spoke Arabic--just a little
   problem. It would just sit there. But none of us really knew what we
   were doing, and we had management who didn't know what they
   were doing either. The problem is, and I just can't stress enough


                                      155

                           B O O K T W O : T A R G E T S

   what the agency [CIA] does to tackle their problems--they just
   throw people and money at the issue. It doesn't matter what the
   outcome is, it doesn't matter what the product of that is. It's just
   comforting to them to know that in this office next to me, he's got
   twenty people sitting there--doesn't matter what they're doing, but
   we've got them sitting there and that makes me feel like I'm getting
   something done, you know, that we're tackling this problem.
      After September 11 happened, I think working from a position of
   chaos is understandable, because we were all shell-shocked. Every-
   body was, like, sleeping at the agency; we'll read traffic, we'll put
   out cables--whatever you want--we'll man telephones. There was
   a lot of momentum for out-of-box kind of thinking and freethink-
   ing and everything else. But it was a very chaotic time, and what
   we were able to accomplish was probably very good given what we
   were working under. Two years after September 11, it's not accept-
   able to continue to be working from that same position of chaos,
   because we haven't stepped back--we let the momentum carry us
   along, but we fell back on the old ways of doing things, which is
   just shove people on the problem.


   According to the former official turned contractor, the surge in staffing
the agency's Counterterrorism Center (CTC) left many of the agency's
area divisions around the world depleted. Because of the "need to surge
hundreds and hundreds at CTC," he said, "there's nobody in these area
divisions anymore, everybody's working the CT target. Africa Division
is smaller now than the number of people we have in Baghdad. The entire
division. And the people in Baghdad are just sitting."
   Afghanistan has also proved difficult for the CIA, according to a num-
ber of current and former agency officials. One said:


   We were talking to teams in the field who were in Afghanistan ev-
   ery night. I was working the night shift all the time, and I would
   talk to the guys because that's when they were awake and doing
   things. [They were] using a secure phone via Inmarsat, and then
   we have a STU [Secure Telephone Unit] on the other end--we had
   several teams. I would ask, "What's going on? How are you all do-
   ing?" They weren't doing anything. And they were so frustrated.


                                      156

                                     W A R

   People were leaving . . . There was one team that just left, they just
   up and left, because they were going to be extended and they had
   already stayed over their stay or whatever, and they had sent mes-
   sages saying we're not doing anything here, and we've got family,
   and we have jobs, and we hear now that you're thinking of extend-
   ing us--and this was probably a day before the helicopter was sup-
   posed to come and take them away. They got on that helicopter and
   they left.
      Their job was to collect intelligence. But this is what was hap-
   pening--you'd go into this village and you'd have ten or fifteen
   people come up to you and go, "I know where bin Laden is." So
  you give them a hundred bucks and you never see them again. [The
   informants were also given a handheld GPS to pinpoint exact loca-
   tions.] The GPS was to be taken to wherever bin Laden was, and
   they would write down the latitude and longitude. And so a lot of
   cable traffic has come and gone based on all of this information,
   from all of these people who come in and say they know where bin
   Laden is.
      And of course, they don't--they want the money. Or if someone
   does in all good faith, they only heard it through a cousin who heard
   it from their cousin who heard it from a cousin who heard it from
   a cousin. It's so ineffective. I'm not saying that that's not the right
  way to go about it, but what I am saying is it's not working . . . Let's
   think of another way to do that. Because the war in Iraq, which the
   Pentagon had promised would be over quickly--followed by happy,
   cheering crowds--instead quickly dissolved into a quagmire, the
   CIA was caught short. Instead of the eighty-five Clandestine Ser-
  vice officers it had originally planned to send, it was forced to rush
   to the battlefield four times that number.


   Soon more than three hundred full-time case officers were packing
the Baghdad station and more than half a dozen outlying bases. Overall,
CIA personnel in the country soared to more than five hundred--includ-
ing contractors--eclipsing even the Saigon station at the height of the
Vietnam War more than three decades earlier. Despite the surge, quantity
did not translate into quality. Many of the new arrivals had little or no

a year into the war, the total number of CIA employees fluent in Arabic
was still only eighty-three, and many of them spoke a dialect not used on
the streets in Iraq.
   This required the CIA to become heavily dependent on outside transla-
tors, a problematic situation in terms of both security and effectiveness.
Thus, there was little improvement in penetrating Iraqi resistance forces
or learning who was behind the insurgency. To make up for the green
arrivals, the CIA was forced to turn to hundreds of volunteers from its
reserve force of homebound retirees, many of whom have long been away
from the field and are of limited usefulness. Also, because they are ro-
tated in and out so quickly--often for just ninety days at a time--there is
little time to accomplish much. The confusion has also had a detrimental
effect on the agency's relationship with a number of regional Iraqi lead-
ers who have become frustrated over their inability to establish liaison
relations with CIA officers. According to one former case officer who
still maintains close ties to the agency, the CIA was stretched to the limit.
"With Afghanistan, the war on terrorism, with Iraq, I think they're just
sucking wind," he said.
   Among the other handicaps faced by the station is the endless violence
that has forced the agency to require that all employees leaving secure
facilities be accompanied by an armed bodyguard. Under such condi-
tions, developing sources and conducting clandestine meetings are all but
impossible. "How do you do your job that way?" asked one former CIA
official who had spent time in Iraq. "They don't know what's going on
out there."
   In addition to fighting wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, the NSA was also
doing battle on a third front: the homeland. And for that they needed the
secret and illegal cooperation of the telecommunications industry.

S   ince the dawn of the space age, the NSA had eavesdropped on the
   world by mapping the heavens, determining the orbit of each com-
munications satellite, analyzing its transponders, calculating frequencies,
azimuths, and a thousand other details and then catching the signals as
they poured down like rain. But by the late 1990s, more and more com-
munications companies began switching their networks from satellites,
with their half-second time delay and occasional atmospheric interfer-
ence, to buried fiber-optic cables. There on the muddy seabed, inside
thick black cables encased in tar-soaked nylon yarn, millions of voices
chat away and terabytes of e-mail zap back and forth. With its bundles of
tiny, hair-thin glass strands, fiber-optic technology offers greater volume,
more security, and higher reliability.
  The problem for the NSA was that as telephone calls sank from deep
space to deep oceans and deep underground, Echelon began living on bor-
rowed time. "The powers that be are trying to kill it so fast because it's a
legacy [outmoded] system," one NSA official told the author a few weeks
before the attacks on 9/11. "We probably won't even use it in two or three
years. It's an outdated mode of Sigint. Just 1 percent of the world's com-
munications travel by satellite now--and much of that is U.S. communi-
cations. The amount of intelligence gained from Echelon is still relatively
high, because we've been so slow in going to those other modes of com-
munications. There's talk about a 300 percent growth in fiber-optic com-
munications, and the packet switching [Internet and e-mail] is now up


                                     161

                        B O O K T H R E E : C O O P E R A T I O N

through the roof." Many of the satellite companies were making up for
their loss in phone calls and e-mail by catering to the enormous growth in
cable television channels.
   Another NSA official agreed that Echelon has become largely obsolete
but says it still provides useful, but limited, intelligence. "There are still
things that you can pick up," the official said. "You can get some limited
cell phone stuff where you have access to people using cell phones on
the ground. You can get a little bit of cell phone stuff from space, but not
as good as we'd like it. It's getting better, but it's hard. The bad guys are
pretty disciplined about how they use it."
   By 2000, there were more than ninety million miles of fiber-optic ca-
ble in the U.S., and the NSA was facing a second, far more sophisticated
generation of fiber technology. Also up was voice traffic, which had been
increasing in volume at 20 percent a year. This was largely as a result
of new digital cellular communications that were far more difficult for
the NSA to analyze than the old analog signals. Rather than consisting
of voices, the digital signals were made up of data packets that might be
broken up and sent a myriad of different ways.
  "Today you have no idea where that information is being routed," said
one intelligence official. "You may have somebody talking on a telephone
over a landline and the other person talking to them on a cell phone over
a satellite. You don't know how it's being routed, it's going through all
kinds of switches, the information is not where you think it is, and that's
what has created the complexity and that's what we have to figure out
how to deal with."
   Tapping into cables had always been a problem for the NSA--legally
as well as technically. FISA largely gave the agency free rein to eaves-
drop on satellite signals in the U.S. at listening posts such as Sugar Grove
in West Virginia--only requiring a FISA warrant when an American was
actually targeted. But the rules of the game were completely different
for wires, such as transoceanic fiber-optic cables. With wires, the NSA
needed a FISA warrant just to tap in.
   It was a rule that never made much sense to the agency's top lawyer,
Bob Deitz. "The need for a court order should not depend," he said, "on
whether the communications meet the technical definition of `wire com-
munications' or not. These factors were never directly relevant in prin-
ciple, but in the context of yesterday's telecommunications infrastructure


                                         162

                                  S H A M R O C K

were used as a proxy for relevant considerations. Today they are utterly
irrelevant."
   Now that the NSA had decided to secretly ignore FISA, the issue was
moot and the time had come to reinvent Echelon from the seabed up.
While the cooperative worldwide satellite-tapping program would remain
in place, the agency would develop a new version, what might be dubbed
Echelon II, targeting the fiber-optic cables that were encasing the world
like a spider's web. It would require an enormous change in technology,
but more important, the NSA and the other members of Five Eyes--Brit-
ain, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand--would have to get access to
the cables either through secret agreements or covertly, or both.
   For Hayden it meant going to the telecommunications industry and
secretly asking for their cooperation. Despite its questionable legality, it
was a practice that had begun long before Hayden--and it ended in the
mid-1970s with the worst trauma in the NSA's history, which came close
to landing senior officials behind bars and exposing the NSA's deepest
secrets for all the world to see. Now Hayden had to decide whether to risk
putting his agency through the nightmare once again, and put employees
at legal risk, by secretly climbing back in bed with the telecoms.
   The rocky marriage between the NSA and the telecommunications in-
dustry began in a brownstone town house on Manhattan's East Side dur-
ing the days following World War I. The building, a few steps off Fifth
Avenue, was the home of the NSA's earliest predecessor, a highly secret
organization known as the Black Chamber.
   Formed in 1919 to continue the code-breaking activities of the military
during the First World War, the agency was run by Herbert O. Yardley,
a poker-playing Hoosier who had been in charge of MI-8, the army's
cryptanalytic organization, during the war. To hide the Chamber's exis-
tence, the town house at 3 East 38th Street masqueraded as a commercial
code company. But after hiring his first novice code breakers, Yardley
was faced with an immediate problem: how to get the messages to and
from the foreign embassies and consulates in Washington and New York.
Without messages there could be no solutions.
   During the war, companies like Western Union were required under
censorship laws to turn over to the military all of those communications.
But when the war ended, so did censorship, and the privacy of telegraph
messages was again guaranteed by the Radio Communication Act of


                                       163

                       B O O K T H R E E : C O O P E R A T I O N

1912. To the Black Chamber, however, the statute represented a large
obstacle that had to be overcome--illegally, if necessary.
  The first steps were taken by Yardley's boss, General Marlborough
Churchill, director of military intelligence, who made a very quiet call
on the president of Western Union, Newcomb Carlton. After the men
"had put all our cards on the table," Yardley would later write, "President
Carlton seemed anxious to do everything he could for us." Under the
agreed-on arrangements, a messenger called at Western Union's Wash-
ington office each morning and took the telegrams to the office of the
Military Intelligence Division in Washington. They were then returned to
Western Union before the close of the same day.
  All American Cable Company, which handled communications be-
tween North and South America, also agreed. Company executive W. E.
Roosevelt had no hesitation. "The government can have anything it wants,"
he declared. Eventually, the Black Chamber obtained the secret and illegal
cooperation of almost the entire American cable industry.
   Concerned about ending up on a criminal docket, however, all the
companies later withdrew their secret cooperation. One factor that may
have had some influence was the enactment of the Radio Act of 1927,
which greatly broadened the Radio Communication Act enacted in 1912.
Whereas the 1912 act made it a crime only for the employees of the cable
and telegraph companies to divulge the contents of the messages to unau-
thorized persons, the 1927 act closed the loophole by also making liable
to criminal penalties those who received such unauthorized communica-
tions. One exception allowed for the acquisition of messages "on demand
of lawful authority," but Yardley and his ultra-secret Black Chamber
could hardly avail themselves of this channel.
   Unwilling to give up in spite of the law and the refusals of the company
executives, Yardley eventually resorted to a different method to obtain
the messages needed to keep the Black Chamber in business: bribery. Af-
ter developing sources in Western Union, Postal Telegraph, All American
Cable, and Mackay Radio, he secretly put them on the Black Chamber's
payroll, paying them in untraceable cash.
   In the end, the Black Chamber faced doom not for lack of telegrams
but for lack of support by Yardley's own government. In March of 1929,
with the inauguration of Herbert Clark Hoover, the conservative Henry L.
Stimson became the new secretary of state. Upon discovery of the Black


                                        164

                                 S H A M R O C K

Chamber he became outraged that gentlemen would eavesdrop on other
gentlemen--even if they were potential foreign adversaries. Branding the
Black Chamber highly illegal, he at once cut off all money for it, and at
midnight on Halloween 1929, the doors to the Black Chamber officially
closed as quietly as they had opened.
   But following World War II, history repeated itself. As in the First
World War, the end of hostilities also brought the end of censorship and
thus the end of access to the millions of cables entering and leaving the
country each year. This time instead of Yardley it was Brigadier General
W. Preston Corderman, the chief of the Signal Security Agency, successor
to the Black Chamber, who faced the same problem. Hoping like Yardley
to work out a secret agreement with the telecoms, Corderman, on Au-
gust 18, 1945, sent two trusted representatives to New York City for the
delicate purpose of making "the necessary contacts with the heads of the
commercial communications companies in New York, secure their ap-
proval of the interception of all [foreign] Government traffic entering the
United States, leaving the United States, or transiting the United States,
and make the necessary arrangements for this photographic intercept
work."
   Their first overture, to an official of ITT Communications, met with
complete failure. He "very definitely and finally refused," Corderman was
informed, to agree to any of the proposals. Next, they approached a vice
president of Western Union, who agreed to cooperate unless the attorney
general of the United States ruled that such intercepts were illegal.
   Armed with this agreement, the two went back to ITT the next day and
suggested to a vice president that "his company would not desire to be the
only non-cooperative company on the project." The implication was that
to refuse was to be less than patriotic, so the vice president went to see
the company president about the matter. A short while later he returned
and indicated that ITT would be willing to cooperate provided that the
attorney general decided the program was not illegal. That same day the
two SSA officers shuttled across town to RCA corporate headquarters.
With two-thirds of America's cable industry already in their pocket, they
met with RCA's president, David Sarnoff, and asked him to join in the
"patriotic" effort. The executive indicated his willingness to cooperate
with the agency but withheld his final approval until he, like the others,
had heard from the attorney general.


                                      165

                         B O O K T H R E E : C O O P E R A T I O N

   But a few days later the three telecom executives met with their corpo-
rate attorneys, who uniformly advised them against participating in the
intercept program. The problem, the SSA officers told Corderman, was
"the fear of the illegality of the procedure according to present FCC regu-
lations." The memo also noted, "In spite of the fact that favorable opin-
ions have been received from the Judge Advocate General of the Army, it
was feared that these opinions would not be protected." Then the officers
indicated a possible solution. "If a favorable opinion is handed down by
the attorney general, this fear will be completely allayed, and cooperation
may be expected for the complete intercept coverage of this material."
   Nevertheless, despite the lack of an authorization by the attorney gen-
eral and the warnings of their legal advisors, within a matter of weeks
the chiefs of all three companies began taking part in what, for security
reasons, was given the code name Operation Shamrock. By September
1, 1945, even before the Articles of Surrender were signed by Japan, the
first batch of cables had been secretly turned over to the agency. Within
a year, however, the complex arrangement threatened to come unglued
when both Western Union and RCA again expressed concern over the
illegality of their participation and the lack of attorney general approval.
In a somewhat feeble effort to pacify the nervous executives, General
Dwight Eisenhower, the army's chief of staff, forwarded to each of them
a formal letter of appreciation.
   Again, throughout 1947, the fear of criminal prosecution continued
to hound the executives of all three companies. They were now demand-
ing assurances, not only from the secretary of defense and the attorney
general, but also from the president himself, that their participation was
in the national interest and that they would not be subject to prosecution
in the federal courts. To ease their concern, Secretary of Defense James
Forrestal asked them to meet with him on Tuesday, December 16, 1947.
It was an extraordinary meeting, attended by Sosthenes Behn, chairman
and president of ITT, and General Harry C. Ingles, president of RCA
Communications. Joseph J. Egan, president of Western Union, was in-
vited but could not attend.
   At the meeting, Forrestal, telling the group that he was speaking for
President Truman, commended them for their cooperation in Operation
Shamrock and requested their continued assistance, "because the intel-
ligence constituted a matter of great importance to the national security."


                                          166

                                S H A M R O C K

Forrestal then said that "so long as the present attorney general [Tom C.
Clark] was in office, he could give assurances that the Department of
Justice would also do all in its power to give the companies full protec-
tion." One official was still unclear as to Shamrock's level of authoriza-
tion, however, and asked Forrestal if he was speaking not just for the
office of the secretary of defense, but in the name of the president of the
United States. Forrestal replied that he was.
  With an eye to the national elections, coming up in less than a year, For-
restal made it clear that "while it was always difficult for any member of
the Government to attempt to commit his successor, he could assure the
gentlemen present that if the present practices continued the Government
would take whatever steps were possible to see to it that the companies
involved would be protected." The next month, Western Union president
Joseph J. Egan and the company's operating vice president were briefed
on the December meeting.
   Forrestal's assurances that Shamrock had the full backing of the presi-
dent as well as the attorney general appeared to satisfy the three for the
time being, but there was no guarantee just how long that would last.
Then, on March 28, 1949, Forrestal resigned from office and in less than
a week he was admitted to Bethesda Naval Hospital suffering from se-
vere depression, anxiety, and acute paranoia. In the early morning hours
of Sunday, May 22, he walked across the hallway into a small kitchen,
tied one end of his dressing gown sash to a radiator just beneath a win-
dow, and knotted the other end around his neck. Seconds later, his body
plunged from the hospital's sixteenth-floor window.
   Among those stunned by Forrestal's death were the company chiefs he
had secretly assured fifteen months earlier. On hearing of Forrestal's res-
ignation and hospitalization, they had sought a renewal of the assurances
against prosecution from his successor, Louis Johnson. On Wednesday,
May 18, 1949, only four days before Forrestal's suicide, Johnson met
with these officials and stated that President Truman, Attorney General
Tom Clark, and he endorsed the Forrestal statement and would provide
them with a guarantee against any criminal action that might arise from
their assistance.
   Confirming the fact that the knowledge of Shamrock went well be-
yond the office of the secretary of defense were two handwritten notes
penned on the memorandum of the meeting. One approval bore the ini-


                                     167

                        B O O K T H R E E : C O O P E R A T I O N

tials T.C.C., those of Attorney General Tom C. Clark; the other, signed by
Secretary Johnson, stated, "OK'd by the President and Tom Clark." The
May 18 meeting was the last time any of the companies ever sought as-
surances against prosecution from the government.
   In 1952, the NSA was formed and took over the program, running it
largely unchanged until the early 1960s, when the paper telegrams gave
way to computer discs containing all messages entering, leaving, or tran-
siting the country. NSA employees would secretly collect the discs from
the telecom companies during the midnight shift, copy them, and then
send the copies to Fort Meade and take the originals back to the com-
panies before the end of the shift. The operation was discovered during
the intelligence investigations of the mid-1970s and NSA officials came
close to going to jail. To prevent future NSA directors from ever again
turning this agency inward on the American public, Congress passed
FISA in 1978 giving the FISA court the "exclusive" authority to approve
or deny any NSA request to spy on Americans. The penalty was five
years in prison for every violation.
   Despite the law, like Yardley and Corderman before him, Hayden de-
cided to ignore the court and secretly begin seeking the cooperation of
the country's telecoms. Testing the water even before 9/11, Hayden made
an initial approach to Joseph P. Nacchio, the head of Qwest Communica-
tions and one of the leaders of the fiber-optic revolution. On February 27,
2001, Nacchio was waved through the gates and quickly disappeared into
the NSA's secret city.




                                         168

                                Qwest



A   small, sassy upstart based in Denver, Qwest was building a world-
    wide infrastructure of hyperfast fiber-optic cables to channel e-mail,
data, and phone calls to the exploding Internet. Packed tightly with hair-
thin strands of glass, each capable of 1.5 million calls, the fiber-optic
cables were quickly making the existing copper cables seem as archaic as
smoke signals. By the time Nacchio joined the company in 1997, it had
a thirteen-thousand-mile network of fiber-optic cable, laid alongside rail-
road tracks around the country, serving four and a half million custom-
ers. With a goal of quickly extending the fiber coast-to-coast, Nacchio
claimed that when his network was completed in the summer of 1999, it
would have greater capacity than those of AT&T, MCI WorldCom, and
Sprint--combined. He was also pushing to expand the company's Euro-
pean network and branching out to Japan.
   Among those impressed by the young company and its new boss were
senior officials at the NSA. At the time, the agency was looking to con-
tract with a U.S. company for a secure fiber-optic network connecting a
number of the agency's key listening posts in the U.S. to its Maryland
headquarters. But because it would be used to pass encrypted, ultra-se-
cret intercepts, it was essential that the network be both very secret and
very secure. That meant an "air gap"--a physical separation between the
NSA's fibers and those of other networks. Based on their analysis, agency
officials determined that the best system for both speed and security be-
longed to Qwest.


                                    169

                        B O O K T H R E E : C O O P E R A T I O N

   Wasting little time, an official from the "Maryland Procurement Of-
fice," the cover name for the NSA's contracting department, telephoned
a cryptic request to Dean Wandry, the chief of Qwest's government busi-
ness unit. A general, said the caller, would like to meet with him and
Nacchio very soon. Two weeks later the mysterious three-star lieutenant
general turned up with a military aide at Nacchio's corporate suite atop
Denver's fifty-two-story Qwest Tower. He said he had heard of Qwest's
new network and asked to meet privately with Wandry, whom the agency
had already secretly vetted. As the two stepped into a separate conference
room, the general told Wandry he had looked at Qwest's network and
wanted his agency to become a customer. Nacchio was excited; it would
be his company's first major government contract--and his entrée into
the black world of the cyberspies.
   Although the agency solicited bids from other companies, it was mostly
pro forma because only Qwest could provide the agency with a custom
"virtual private network," complete with hardware, engineering, commu-
nications services, and network management. By May 1998--lightning
fast by government standards--Qwest was awarded the ten-year, $430
million contract. Nacchio, who by then had also received his NSA clear-
ance, wanted to publicly announce the deal to boost the company's repu-
tation, but the NSA forbade even a whisper. That same year, Qwest also
built a similar secure network for the NSA linking listening posts in Eu-
rope and the Middle East to a transatlantic cable.
   Realizing the potential of the company's new cloak-and-dagger role,
Wandry told Nacchio: "If managed correctly," the relationship with the
NSA "would become extremely lucrative for Qwest." It would also be-
come extremely lucrative for Nacchio. A man who once sprinted miles
to the finish line of the New York marathon despite oozing blood from
one foot, Nacchio had become the Gordon Gekko of the telecom world as
growth, profit, and personal wealth quickly became obsessions. In meet-
ings, his nervous energy would cause his hands to fidget and in conver-
sations he would answer questions before they were completely asked.
Above all, he thrived on taking calculated risks, combining gut instinct
with hard analysis. It was a philosophy he dubbed "informed opportun-
ism" while earning a master of science degree in management at MIT.
   By 2000, thanks to a $45.2 billion merger with U.S. West, a "Baby
Bell" that served fourteen western states, he had turned his small com-


                                         170

                                   Q W E S T

pany into the fourth-largest telecom in the country. He started with fewer
than a thousand employees, but following the merger Qwest ballooned to
71,000 employees, more than 29 million customers, about $18.5 billion
in sales, and a 25,000-mile network extending from Los Angeles to New
York and Washington, D.C.
   Like hyperactive moles, Qwest employees crisscrossed the U.S. and
Europe burying superfast cable in four-foot trenches to connect cities,
towns, and companies to the Internet. The company's slogan became
"Ride the Light," and Nacchio would boast that Qwest would soon be
bigger than his previous employer, AT&T. "I feel like an emerging oil
baron," he told one reporter. Addressing a crowd of executives, he de-
clared, "Qwest is all about being aggressive. We're going to dominate."
  With all the acquisitions, however, also came sky-high debt as Nacchio
poured truckloads of cash into improving U.S. West's long history of
lackluster customer service (giving it the nickname "U.S. Worst"). At the
same time, with all the overbuilding there was a glut in capacity. While
Qwest's extensive network was capable of carrying all the voice and data
traffic in the entire U.S., its share of telecom traffic never exceeded 4
or 5 percent. That meant thousands of miles of unused or "dark" cable.
Qwest's debt would soon balloon to more than $26 billion.
   Fearing that Wall Street investors would nervously begin backing
away from his company if they saw signs of a setback, Nacchio turned in-
creasingly ruthless. He slashed eleven thousand employees from the pay-
roll--mostly inherited from U.S. West--and created a culture of fear for
those who remained. He demanded that managers continue to match or
better Wall Street's predictions of double-digit revenue growth--or join
the unemployment lines. The "most important thing we do is make our
numbers," he warned employees in January 2001. During a sales confer-
ence at the swank Bellagio Hotel in Las Vegas, he threw out tennis balls
stuffed with cash into a ballroom packed with his neatly attired marketing
force. Then he laughed as they scrambled, pushed, and dived like hungry
packs of wolves for the prizes.
   To keep from being fired, managers resorted to shell games and smoke
and mirrors in place of proper accounting methods. Revenue from deals
spread out over years was instead counted as cash up front. One-time
sales were recorded on the ledger as recurring revenue. Capacity was

sales. "Our experience told us that any time you puff up the revenue like
a giant souffle," said one vice president who quit, "sooner or later it all
rushes back out."
   By January 2001, the stock was sliding and Qwest executives and au-
ditors began worrying about what the SEC would find if it started snoop-
ing around. Seeing the coming meltdown, that month Nacchio quietly
began unloading more than $100 million worth of his stock in the com-
pany while at the same time telling stockholders, potential investors, and
the public that Qwest's future could not be brighter. In the world of high
finance, it was known as insider trading, a very serious crime.
   As Nacchio was dumping his stock by the truckload, he learned of
a new and potentially sweet contract with the NSA. Known as Project
Groundbreaker, the plan involved allowing outside contractors, for the
first time, to come in and upgrade and manage many of the agency's
powerful computer and telecommunications systems. With the agency
simultaneously falling behind technologically and needing to continue
to downsize, Groundbreaker was designed to bring the agency into the
twenty-first century technologically while also reducing its workforce.
   Under the terms of the contract, the hundreds of employees who pre-
viously worked in the IT billets would be let go by the agency and then
hired by the outside companies to work on the contracts. Thus, most
would simply stay at their jobs while their paychecks came from a new
employer. The idea was to free up the agency to focus on its core mis-
sions--eavesdropping, code breaking, and code making. "Essentially, the
problem for this agency is we downsized a third [over the past twelve
years] while the larger world has undergone the most significant revolu-
tion in human communications since Gutenberg," said Hayden. "We have
got to get the technology of the global telecommunications revolution
inside this agency."
   On February 27, 2001, two weeks after Qwest inaugurated local
broadband service in Washington and Baltimore, Nacchio and the new
head of Qwest's government business unit, James F. X. Payne, arrived
at the NSA. They had come to present their proposal to become part of
the Groundbreaker project. Although the company was on the list of po-
tential subcontractors, Nacchio was looking to up the ante by outlining
a much larger role for the company. Neither, however, was prepared for
the agency's counteroffer: to give the NSA secret, warrantless access to


                                        172

                                     Q W E S T

Qwest's database containing the calling records of its millions of Ameri-
can customers. And possibly later, to give Nacchio's blessing to install
monitoring equipment on the company's Class 5 switching facilities, the
system over which most of the company's domestic traffic flows.
   No doubt to Hayden's surprise, despite Nacchio's penchant for risk-
taking, he declined to have anything to do with the agency illegally in-
stalling its monitoring equipment on the company's switching facilities.
Although some international traffic passed through those switches--the
traffic Hayden was interested in--they primarily transmitted only local-
ized calls, such as neighborhood to neighborhood. While he never flatly
said no, Nacchio wanted no part of the operation. Having spent his entire
career in the long distance telephone business, he felt such an agreement
would be illegal--a view shared by his in-house attorneys in Denver.
They believed any such cooperation--even if limited to e-mail--would
violate the Electronic Communications Privacy Act.
   Enacted in 1986, the law extended the telephone wiretap provisions
to include electronic information transmitted by and stored in computers.
If the NSA wanted to obtain his data, Nacchio decided, all it had to do
was enter the company through the front door with a warrant from the
Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, not through the back door with
a whisper and a wink. "Nacchio said it was a legal issue, and they should
not do something their general counsel told them not to do," said Payne.
"Nacchio projected that he might do it if they could find a way to do it
legally."
   According to Payne, the NSA did not take the rejection well. "Subse-
quent to the meeting," he said, "the customer came back and expressed
disappointment at Qwest's decision." The agency, he said, would never
let it drop. "It went on for years," said Payne. "In meetings after meetings,
they would bring it up." At one point Payne suggested to Nacchio "that
they just tell them no." But, Payne noted, he "realized at this time that
`no' was not going to be enough for them." While Qwest eventually was
added as one of about thirty-five subcontractors for Groundbreaker, the
company never received the other, larger slice of the action it was seeking.
Later, when charged with insider trading, Nacchio would claim the rejec-
tion was retaliation for his refusing to go along with what his lawyers told
him was an illegal request by the NSA.
   Despite being turned down flat by Nacchio in 2001, Hayden was hop-

ing that by waving the flag after the 9/11 attacks he could convince the
wary executives to overlook a possible jail term and endless lawsuits by
angry customers should the secret come out. Without their cooperation,
there was no way to gain access to the critical fiber-optic transmission
lines.

                               Cables



O   nce a lonely place with a few dozen copper cables carrying expensive
    conversations between continents, the seabed now resembles a ball
of string and has truly become the world's information superhighway.
There's the TAT-14 from Tuckerton, New Jersey, to Widemouth, England;
the northern branch of Gemini from Charlestown, Rhode Island, to Porth-
curno, England; and the southern branch from Manasquan, New Jersey,
to Porthcurno. If you want to go to the Middle East and Asia you can
hitch a ride on FLAG. And ARCOS-1 will take you from Miami to four-
teen countries in Central America, South America, and the Caribbean.
   As satellite dishes began sprouting like toadstools in the 1960s, under-
sea cables became almost an anachronism, like the telegraph. But thanks
to the Internet and low-cost, high-density glass fiber, the volume of inter-
national communications transmitted over subsea cables zoomed from 2
percent in 1988 to 80 percent by 2000. At the same time, new technolo-
gies such as wave division multiplexing (WDM) and synchronous digital
hierarchy (SDH) enabled companies to squeeze ever more information
into the same cables without the need to expand their size.
   The revolution was not limited to the deep seas. For decades, many
of the world's domestic and regional communications were carried over
microwaves. Pencil-thin signals that carried thousands of phone conver-
sations, they were beamed between conical and horn-shaped antennas
over giant networks of towers like needles on a porcupine. For the NSA,
all that was required to tap into those communications was to hide their


                                    175

                         B O O K T H R E E : C O O P E R A T I O N

own antenna somewhere within the twenty-mile beam of the microwave
signal as it zapped from one tower to the next.
   Another advantage for the NSA was that microwaves traveled in a
straight line. Thus, because of the curvature of the earth, they would
eventually pass into deep space. By putting a geostationary satellite in
their path, the agency would be able to relay all those conversations in
real time down to a listening post and then to headquarters. This tech-
nique was a boon to the NSA during the Cold War. Because much of
Russia's Siberia is permanently sealed under a deep layer of permafrost,
burying landlines was impossible. Therefore, a series of microwave tow-
ers stretched from Moscow to its commands in the far eastern parts of
the country, such as Vladivostok. As the microwave signals passed from
tower to tower and on into space, the NSA was there, 22,300 miles above,
listening in with a satellite named Rhyolite.
   But as the fiber-optic revolution took hold, microwave towers around
the world slowly began disappearing like steel dinosaurs, and satellite
dishes gave way to underground trenches and cable-laying ships. Not
only were the new cables more reliable than the satellites, which had to
contend with atmospheric interruptions, they were also much faster--of
critical importance for both standard voice communications and the rap-
idly growing Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP). Satellite signals must
travel at least forty-five thousand miles as they zap from caller to deep
space and then back down to the receiver, producing an annoying time
delay of between one-quarter and one-half a second. But the time delay
across the ocean by cable is only about one-thirtieth of a second and un-
noticeable.
   Finally, there was the relatively low cost of undersea communica-
tions--partly as a result of massive overbuilding in anticipation of greater
and greater Internet demand, such as that done by Nacchio's Qwest. Be-
tween 1999 and 2002, the capacity of the global undersea grid grew more
than fifteen times, a development not lost on Michael Hayden.
   In order to tap into the U.S. telecommunications system, the NSA stud-
ied a variety of "switches," central nodes and key crossroads where mil-
lions of communications come together before being distributed to other
parts of the country. Among them were the half dozen or so cable landing
stations on each coast. Like border crossings, they are the points of en-




                                          176

                                   C A B L E S

try for all international cable communications. Small, nondescript build-
ings in little towns near the shore, they usually give no hint that tens of
millions of communications are constantly passing through them--more
than 80 percent of all international communications.
   Typical is AT&T's landing station at Tuckerton, New Jersey, one of the
busiest communications hubs in the world. It is the gateway for a num-
ber of international cables to Europe, the Caribbean, and South America,
including TAT-14 (for Trans-Atlantic Telephone). Containing nearly ten
million circuits and operating at 640 gigabits per second, TAT-14 con-
nects the U.S. with Britain and much of Europe. Built as a nine-thousand-
mile loop, it goes from Tuckerton to England, France, the Netherlands,
Germany, Denmark, and back to New Jersey. Communications to and
from the Middle East and elsewhere are funneled into and out of the Eu-
ropean landing stations by microwave, landline, or satellite. TAT-14 then
transports the traffic between those points and Tuckerton at the speed of
light.
   Tuckerton has a long history of international communications; in 1912
the nation's tallest radio tower was built just to the south. At the time,
it was the only transmitter capable of broadcasting to Europe without a
relay. Today the town still keeps the U.S. connected to Europe and be-
yond, but now instead of a giant transmitter, it does so from a nondescript,
sandy-colored two-story building on a small rural road about a mile from
the Jersey shore. Surrounded by pines, at first glance the AT&T landing
station appears to be a modern apartment complex for beachgoers. But on
closer examination, the windows are all blacked out and the heavy-duty,
electrically operated gate looks more like it should be at an American
embassy than a remote summer vacation spot. In reality, much of the
facility is deep underground.
   After transiting the Atlantic, the cable, buried in a trench in the sand,
continues underground, where it is accessible through manhole covers,
and then finally enters through the subterranean wall of the station. There
the signals are converted and transmitted to other AT&T locations for
further distribution around the country. Some customers connect directly
to the station and then "backhaul" their data to a distant location, such
as New York City. It is at switches such as these that the NSA began
placing its equipment, capturing mirror images of what was coming in.




                                     177

                        B O O K T H R E E : C O O P E R A T I O N

Then, over encrypted fiber-optic cables, it would backhaul the millions of
phone calls and messages in real time to its headquarters in Fort Meade or
to one of its key analytical facilities elsewhere in the country.
   But while the consolidation of so much of America's worldwide com-
munications into a few thin cables on each coast might make life easy
for the NSA in its fight against terrorists, it also presents an extremely
tempting target for terrorists. By 2002, the total capacity of the ten in-
ternational cables entering the east coast was nearly 8.5 billion circuits,
with the ability to transfer over 206 gigabytes of data per second. Six of
the ten cables come ashore in a small cluster of just four cities on the east
coast: Tuckerton, Manasquan, and Manahawkin along the Jersey coast,
and Charlestown in Rhode Island. Like the Internet, AT&T's voice calls
have also ballooned in recent years, from 37.5 million on an average busi-
ness day in 1984 to 300 million in 1999.
  "Theoretically, an attack on two or three of these sites--at the point
where the cables come together in the undersea trench before coming
ashore--could cause enormous damage to the entire system," said a 2002
RAND study. "For instance, a successful attack on trenches in Tuckerton
and Manasquan and Charlestown would eliminate all but 11 gigabytes
per second of carrying capacity in that region--a 95 percent cut." As an
example of the chaos that might result from such a loss, a few years ago
one cut cable on the SWM 3 network leading from Australia to Singapore
caused Australia's largest Internet provider--Telstra--to lose up to 70
percent of its Internet capacity.
  As the NSA began secretly approaching the telecommunications ex-
ecutives, once again Joe Nacchio and Qwest became a stumbling block.
In early 2001 he had refused to allow the agency permission to install
monitoring equipment on its Class 5 switching facilities, over which trav-
eled primarily domestic communications. Now, approached again by the
NSA following the 9/11 attacks, he again refused. "Mr. Nacchio made
inquiry as to whether a warrant or other legal process had been secured
in support of that request," said his lawyer, Herbert J. Stern. "When he
learned that no such authority had been granted, and that there was disin-
clination on the part of the authorities to use any legal process," Nacchio
concluded that the requests violated federal privacy requirements "and
issued instructions to refuse to comply." But Qwest was a small player

compared to some of the others and Hayden set his sights on them, espe-
cially AT&T and Verizon.
   By then AT&T had discovered the answer to one of the key technical
problems facing the NSA as its giant eavesdropping dishes became relics
of a bygone time: how to tap into the delicate fiber-optic cables now link-
ing continent to continent, country to country, and caller to caller.
   Little ever happens in the sleepy town of Bridgeton, just outside of St.
Louis, on the muddy banks of the Mississippi. "The original 15 blocks
were platted in 1794, shortly after our nation was founded," its Web page
proudly boasts. "We also hold the oldest continuous state charter, which
was granted in 1843." But since then it had been quiet times, until 2002.
That year a long-held secret was revealed, and another event became
shrouded in utmost secrecy.
   It had been a dry, hot summer, and as the chocolate river slowly re-
treated, the outline of a giant rib cage began to emerge. It was the skeletal
hull of a nineteenth-century steamboat coming into view for the first time
in 120 years. At 280 feet, the Montana had been one of the longest paddle-
wheelers ever to ply the Mississippi. It was a time of grandeur, when more
than seven hundred steamboats regularly cruised the river, pulling into
the Port of St. Louis to take on passengers and off-load cargo. Along the
city's lively riverfront, colorful boats decked out with flags and bunting
in red, white, and blue lined up for miles. But in June 1884, as the Mon-
tana neared Bridgeton, it collided with a railroad crossing, began taking
on water, and sank into the gooey bottom. Soon the era of the steamboat
came to an end, just as that of the telephone began to take hold.
   That same summer, as Missourians from miles around crowded into
Bridgeton to watch the river giving up its long-held secret, another group
in Bridgeton was going to elaborate lengths to keep a secret. In a boxy,
one-story redbrick building that once housed offices for the Western
Union telegraph company, employees of AT&T were plastering over
the windows, installing steel doors, and constructing a "mantrap." A bi-
onic security portal containing retinal and fingerprint scanners, it was
designed to keep curious workers out and allow the few with Top Secret
NSA clearances in.
   The secret hidden in the room had its beginnings five years earlier
and 934 miles to the northeast, in a laboratory in New Jersey. In the mid-




                                      179

1990s, the Internet revolution met the fiber-optic revolution, raising ques-
tions for scientists at AT&T regarding how fiber-optic systems operate
under a variety of conditions. They needed ways to measure and analyze
the photons as they flashed over the hair-thin strands of fiber bundled
together inside the thick, heavily insulated cable. And the only way to
conduct truly valid tests and measurements was to carry out the experi-
ments on actual live and stored customer traffic, including that from other
telecoms that passed data through AT&T equipment. This meant devel-
oping a way "to tap the network passively," according to confidential
AT&T documents.
   In 1996, the year AT&T inaugurated its WorldNet Internet service, the
task of inventing the tap was given to a small team of scientists at AT&T's
Research Labs in Florham Park, New Jersey. The leafy campus was once
the estate of Vanderbilt descendants. What the team came up with was a
device they called the PacketScope.
   Among the locations chosen for the taps was AT&T's Bridgeton, Mis-
souri, Network Operations Center. A one-story building with a two-story
annex at 12976 Hollenberg Drive, it served as the telecom's technical
command center, a major hub through which AT&T's domestic and in-
ternational data circuits were managed. "They are in command of the
network," said Mark Kline, a longtime AT&T employee. It was thus an
ideal place to tap into and analyze a large portion of the system. Another
location was its WorldNet Router Center at the AT&T Building at 32
Sixth Avenue in New York City, where most of the domestic and inter-
national cables converged. "The New York monitor taps into T3 [a high-
speed cable] links connecting WN [WorldNet] to the rest of the Internet,"
according to the documents. And a third was set up at AT&T Labs in
Florham Park, New Jersey.
   At the Internet hubs in Bridgeton, New York City, and Florham Park,
data flows through DSX-3 panels that are basically automatic switch-
boards redirecting the traffic to other locations. Each link in the panel has
a jack through which the traffic could be monitored. To tap into the data,
lines from the jacks were plugged into the PacketScope, which consisted
of a Compaq 500-MHz UNIX workstation, 10-Gbyte striped disk arrays,
and 140-Gbyte tape robots. As the systems became more complex, how-
ever, it would be necessary to actually tap into the cables themselves. "An
approach others have used is to have an optical splitter, much like the tap


                                         180

                                    C A B L E S

for a T1 or T3 link," said the documents. This optical splitter would cre-
ate a mirror image of the contents of the entire cable.
   Once intercepted by the PacketScopes, the information was transmit-
ted in real time to Florham Park, where AT&T constructed its WorldNet
Data Warehouse to analyze and store information. According to one of
the AT&T engineers working on the project, "The amount of data to be
stored is truly enormous." To hold and manage it all, the warehouse was
home to Daytona, AT&T's monster data storage computer. Engineers at
the Data Warehouse could also remotely control the PacketScopes to tar-
get what to intercept. "That on-site presence of personnel to manage the
monitoring equipment is not essential," said the AT&T documents.
   For the AT&T engineers, ensuring the confidentiality of customers'
e-mail and other data was critical. Thus only packet headers--the ad-
dress information--were intercepted, not the full contents of the e-mail.
The headers were then encrypted to further hide the true identity of the
senders and receivers.
   By the summer of 1997, the PacketScopes were fully in operation. But
what the AT&T engineers never counted on was a massive terrorist at-
tack and a president's decision to ignore existing privacy law. By the
late fall of 2001, Hayden succeeded in gaining the secret cooperation of
nearly all of the nation's telecommunications giants for his warrantless
eavesdropping program. Within a year, engineers were busy installing
highly secret, heavily locked rooms in key AT&T switches, among them
Bridgeton, New York City, and the company's major West Coast central
office in San Francisco. From then on the data--including both address
information and content--would flow through the PacketScopes directly
to the NSA. And Bridgeton would become the technical command center
for the operation. "It was very hush-hush," said one of the AT&T workers
there at the time. "We were told there was going to be some government
personnel working in that room. We were told, `Do not try to speak to
them. Do not hamper their work. Do not impede anything that they're
doing.' "
  "Bridgeton, Missouri, was chosen" for the PacketScope, said Dr. Brian
Reid, a former AT&T scientist at Bell Labs, "because it's roughly close
to the center of North America geographically, and therefore if you're
going to run a lot of wires to it, they don't have to be as long. Whereas if
you put this in New Jersey, then the wires from Phoenix and Los Angeles


                                      181

                         B O O K T H R E E : C O O P E R A T I O N

would be too long. And so if you're going to build a hub for analysis, you
put it somewhere in Missouri or Kansas, and they put it in Missouri . . . In
the world of AT&T, all you had to do was go to Bridgeton and say, `Hi
guys, I'd like to listen,' and you would hear everything you needed to
hear." The problem for the NSA today, says Reid, is the large number
of other telecom companies, all of which would require separate secret
agreements. "Now you'd have to go to the Qwest hub in Denver, and
you'd have to go to the Sprint hub in St. Louis, and you'd have to go to
the Vonage hub in Norway--it's increasingly global, it's increasingly de-
centralized, and there's no longer a small number of places to go to take
advantage of other people's having drawn stuff together. There could be
a hundred places."
   Modeled after Bell Labs, birthplace of the transistor and winner of
eleven Nobel Prizes for brilliant innovations in communications, AT&T
Labs now spent much of its time helping the government conduct mass
surveillance of its customers and seeking patents for ever more sophis-
ticated bugs. One AT&T Labs patent application was called "Secure
detection of an intercepted targeted IP phone from multiple monitoring
locations," and another was titled "Monitoring selected IP voice calls
through activity of a watchdog program at an IP-addressing mapping
check point."
   For decades, AT&T and much of the rest of the telecommunications
industry have had a very secret, very cozy relationship with the NSA
through the National Security Agency Advisory Board (NSAAB), made
up of top company executives. With the advent of the warrantless eaves-
dropping program, the knowledge, expertise, and help of those executives
became even more critical. Because of this, the agency has tried hard to
keep the names of those industry leaders and details of their regular meet-
ing at the NSA secret. Among the previous members was Dr. William O.
Baker, who designed much of America's telecommunications infrastruc-
ture. During the two decades he served on the board he also served, at
various points, as research chief, president, and chairman of the board of
Bell Labs, long the epicenter of telecommunications research. Because
the first operational fiber-optic system was developed under Baker at Bell
Labs, the NSA had a large head start in finding ways to penetrate it.
   The backgrounds of other recent members of the NSAAB also show

the secret linkage between the NSA and the commercial telecom world.
They include:


· Dr. Alf L. Andreassen, an information systems expert. In 1983 he
  founded and became director of Bell Labs Command, Control, Com-
  munication and Intelligence Center and later did similar intelligence
  work for AT&T.


· Dr. George H. Heilmeier, chairman emeritus of Telcordia Technolo-
  gies, Inc., formerly known as Bell Communications Research, Inc.
  (or Bellcore). At the time of the breakup of AT&T, the highly regarded
  Bell Labs stayed with the parent company, and as a result the regional
  Bell operating companies, the Baby Bells, formed their own research
  and development company, which was Bellcore, later Telcordia. Ac-
  cording to the company's literature, "We're one of the world's fore-
  most providers of software and services for IP, wireline, wireless, and
  cable networks."


· David W. Aucsmith, security architect and chief technology officer for
  Microsoft Corp.'s Security Business & Technology Unit. From 1994
  to 2002 he was the chief security architect for Intel Corporation, the
  company whose integrated circuit chips are in millions of personal
  computers around the world. Speaking of computer security, he once
  said, "The actual user of the PC--someone who can do anything they
  want--is the enemy."


· John P. Stenbit, on the board of directors of Loral Space & Communi-
  cations Inc., a satellite communications company that owns and oper-
  ates telecommunications satellites used to distribute broadband data
  and provide access to Internet.


  As on the East Coast, during the late 1990s the amount of telephone
and Internet traffic flowing across the Pacific to the United States boomed.
Among the new pipes through which much of this communication passed
was the eighteen-thousand-mile Southern Cross fiber-optic cable network,
which offered a quantum leap in carrying capacity across the Southern

Pacific--up to 160 gigabytes per second. But the cable in which the NSA
likely had the most interest was China-U.S., owned by a consortium of
companies including AT&T and SBC Communications. Completed in
2000, the southern end of the fourteen-thousand-mile ring begins its long
journey at a landing station in Shantou, a bustling port in the southern
Chinese province of Guangdong known for its tea consumption.
   While there was an obvious foreign intelligence value to monitoring
that cable, there was also a terrorism connection. Many of the commu-
nications from Southeast Asia, including Indonesia and Malaysia, where
al-Qaeda has been very active, were transmitted over the SEA-ME-WE
3 (Southwest Asia­Middle East­Western Europe) cable. That cable then
linked to China-U.S. in Shantou.
   Thus if an American businesswoman in Surabaya, Indonesia, sent an
e-mail to her husband in Cincinnati, the signal would likely be routed
first to the Ancol landing station on a beach area about five miles from
the Indonesian capital of Jakarta. At Ancol, like a passenger boarding a
very fast ship, it would travel over the SEA-ME-WE 3 cable to the Shan-
tou landing station, arriving a millisecond or so later. At Shantou, the
e-mail would transfer to the China-U.S. cable, which, in a few blinks of
an eye, would transport it across the floor of the Pacific Ocean.
   In the U.S., the message would arrive unceremoniously a few feet be-
neath a sandy beach at California's Montana De Oro State Park, near
Morro Bay. Then, after another 2,200 feet inside a five-inch drill pipe
under the drifting dunes, it would emerge in a manhole at the park's Sand
Spit parking lot. Passing beneath the feet of surfers and beachcombers
heading for the shore, the e-mail would zip another mile inland, arriving
at 9401 Los Oso Valley Road in San Luis Obispo, a small, tan-colored
windowless building surrounded by a high steel fence topped with barbed
wire that is AT&T's landing station.
   Despite its quiet surroundings, it is a very busy place. Five of the six
transpacific cables pass under the beach and into that small building. To-
gether, the cables contain 80 percent of all communications to and from
virtually every nation in the Pacific and the Far East--dozens of countries,
hundreds of languages, thousands of cities, tens of millions of simultane-
ous conversations and messages. Sealed in layers of polyethylene, Mylar
tape, stranded steel wires, aluminum sheathing, copper tubing, and pe-
troleum jelly are the heavily protected hair-thin glass fibers. Converted


                                         184

into photons and passing through them at the speed of light are cries and
laughter, hopes and dreams, romance and commerce, voices and pictures,
e-mail and faxes, bank statements and hotel reservations, love poems and
death notices. The only thing they all have in common is a reasonable
expectation of privacy.
   From the landing station, the e-mail from Surabaya, together with mil-
lions of additional communications from all five cables, zaps 241 miles
north to 611 Folsom Street in downtown San Francisco. Tall, forbidding,
and nearly windowless, the titanium-colored nine-story building is, in es-
sence, one big telecommunications switch--the nerve center where all of
AT&T's regional trunk lines converge. Beneath the road, the message en-
ters through the reinforced concrete walls of an underground vault. There
it begins a climb toward the upper floors inside metal ductwork.
   Along the way the messages pass floor after floor of wires--hanging
like spaghetti from ceilings, tied in bundles along the floor, stretched like
insulation along every wall. Old copper wire pairs, they connect neighbor-
hood to neighborhood and local homes to the corner store. Another entire
floor contains the actual "switch," a Northern Telecom DMS-100. Made
up of rows of chocolate-brown cabinets that contain whirring drives and
humming air conditioning, the superprocessor has the ability to juggle
100,000 calls while at the same time broadcasting annoying messages
about misdialed calls and numbers no longer in service.
   On the eighth floor, the cables finally emerge into the WorldNet In-
ternet spaces where their signals are demultiplexed--sorted out between
voice and data, various frequencies, and other details. Then they drop
down to the seventh floor, an expansive space packed with gray elec-
tronic bays and steel racks. Stacked from floor to ceiling are Cisco rout-
ers and modems with flashing red, green, and yellow lights. It is the key
choke point through which millions of e-mail and other data are con-
stantly passing, from across the country and around the world. In addition
to traffic from the international cables, the room is also a hub for a large
percentage of America's domestic communications. The biggest "pipes"
deliver 2.5 gigabits of data--the equivalent of one-quarter of the Ency-
clopaedia Britannica's text--per second.
   "There's lots of Internet traffic, as you can imagine, that goes in and
out of this office," said Mark Kline, the AT&T technician in charge of
the room. For over twenty-two years, Kline had worked for the company


                                     185

                       B O O K T H R E E : C O O P E R A T I O N

as a communications technician and computer network specialist, first
in New York and then in California. "Probably hundreds of fiber-optic
lines go out, carrying billions--that's billions with a B--of bits of data
going in and out every second every day. So all the Web surfing you're
doing, whatever you're doing on the Internet--the pictures, the video, the
Voice over Internet--all that stuff's going in and out of there. And then
of course there's also the traditional phone switch, which is doing what
it's been doing since before the Internet--handling millions and millions
of phone calls."
   Following its merger with SBC, AT&T had become the biggest tele-
communications company in the United States and one of the largest in
the world, providing long-distance service to approximately 34.4 million
customers. Its international voice service carried more than 18 billion
minutes per year, reaching 240 countries, linking 400 carriers, and offer-
ing remote access via 19,500 points of presence in 149 countries around
the globe. And much of those communications passed through its Folsom
Street facility.
   In a sense, the WorldNet Internet room was also a meeting place for
dozens of the nation's major Internet service providers (ISPs). This was
because only a fraction of all the Internet communications flowing into
the room were from actual AT&T WorldNet customers. The rest were
from customers of other Internet companies, such as Sprint, Level 3, and
UUNET. In order to cheaply and efficiently exchange these packets, the
companies enter into "peering" arrangements with one another and with
AT&T, and then bring their pipes together in the WorldNet room at Fol-
som Street. Thus, when the e-mail from Surabaya arrives, it can quickly
be shifted over to the businesswoman's own company, Sprint, for final
delivery to Cincinnati.
   At the same time, many other pipes are also entering Folsom Street
from smaller ISPs. But rather than each running cables from their compa-
nies all the way to downtown San Francisco, they get together at central
locations away from the city, known as Internet exchange points, or IXPs.
There the companies exchange Internet traffic that is addressed to one
another. By coming together, they need only lay a few feet of cable--to
one another's routers--rather than many miles to a variety of locations.
From the IXP, a single cable then goes to Folsom Street, which is another
savings.


                                        186

                                   C A B L E S

   As the Internet has grown, so have the IXPs. Some have taken over en-
tire buildings and become "carrier hotels." But historically, the two most
important IXPs have been MAE (for Metropolitan Area Ethernet) East
in Virginia and MAE West in California. MAE East began in the parking
garage of a high-rise office building at 8100 Boone Boulevard in Vienna,
Virginia, just outside Washington, D.C. "A group of network providers
in the Virginia area got together over beer one night and decided to con-
nect their networks," said the Internet architect Steve Feldman. It soon
exploded as UUNET, MCI, Sprint, America Online, and others joined,
turning it into the busiest Internet hub in the world, a sort of massive
outlet mall for ISPs. It later moved up to a nicer set of offices on one of
the upper floors, Suite 400. Then as it filled up, another major IXP, the
Equinix colocation facility, opened at 21830 UUNET Way in Ashburn,
Virginia. It is now overshadowing MAE East.
   In California, MAE West developed in the heart of Silicon Valley and
quickly became the second-busiest IXP in the world. As the World Wide
Web grew, so too did the nation's "Internet backbone," which largely
stretched between the two MAEs. Today MAE West sits on the eleventh
floor of 55 Market Street, a gold-mirrored building in downtown San Jose.
Every day, behind its steel door secured with a cyberlock, as much as 40
percent of the nation's Internet traffic speeds by. Inside are rows and rows
of black cabinets, each containing a stack of quietly humming routers
belonging to scores of different ISPs. Connected together with bright or-
ange cables, they are constantly exchanging Internet packets. The routers,
in turn, are all wired to the MAE, three bread-box-sized switches capable
of handling a total of 30 billion bits a second. But like MAE East, MAE
West is also becoming upstaged by another IXP: One Wilshire, in Los
Angeles, where over 260 ISPs connect their networks to one another. It
has become the main connecting point for the Pacific Rim countries.
   From MAE West, a fiber-optic cable runs to AT&T's WorldNet In-
ternet room on Folsom Street, where it joins more than a dozen other
cables--"peering links"--from northern California IXPs. But rather than
being connected directly to the routers, which would speed the Internet
packets on to their ultimate destination--the e-mail from Surabaya to
Cincinnati, for example--the cables instead pass into an odd, rectangular
white box. Labeled "Splitter Cabinet," it is in reality a supersophisticated
opto-electronic "bug" designed to tap into fiber-optic cables.


                                     187

                                Splitter



I n the old days of copper telephone wires, a basic tap consisted simply
  of attaching a pair of alligator clips to a telephone wire. Through induc-
tion, the clips pick up the conversations as they leak--or radiate--from
the copper wire. But with glass fibers there is no leakage and thus tapping
through induction is out. Instead, tapping into a fiber-optic cable literally
requires major surgery.
  After the NSA proposed its warrantless eavesdropping scheme to
AT&T, the company's AT&T Labs in New Jersey drew up a step-by-step
guide for the technicians who would carry out the task on the high-capac-
ity cables. Titled "Splitter Cut-In and Test Procedure" and dated January
13, 2003, it said, "This procedure covers the steps required to insert opti-
cal splitters into select live Common Backbone (CBB) [AT&T's nation-
wide system] OC3, OC12 and OC48 optical circuits."
   In preparing for the cut into the cable, the company took a number
of precautions in the event the "surgery" went badly. Instructions were
given to the technicians to begin the operation in the wee hours of the
morning, around two o'clock, when there is the least amount of traffic
moving through the cables.
  Also, in the same way surgeons worry about patients losing too much
blood during an operation, the AT&T cable tappers were concerned that
the fibers would bleed too much light and thus they would lose their pre-
cious signal--and with it millions of e-mails and other data. There was
no way to prevent some loss, but they needed to keep it below seven deci-


                                      188

                                S P L I T T E R

bels--their unit of measurement--and preferably no more than six. As a
precaution, one technician would keep constant track of the decibel level
as the operation was taking place. Any significant decrease in the level
was to be reported immediately to nervous engineers at AT&T's Network
Operations Center in Bridgeton, Missouri, which coordinated the techni-
cal aspects of the program.
   On the night of the operation, all went well inside the "splitter box."
From the cut, mirrorlike images of the photons passing through the glass
fibers were redirected within the box onto a second cable. Once this was
completed, the signals then continued on to the WorldNet modems and
routers. From there, the e-mail and other messages reached their final
destination--and the businesswoman's husband in Cincinnati read the
e-mail she had sent from Surabaya just moments before.
   But the clone cable, with a duplicate copy of the woman's e-mail, took
a different route. It descended one floor below to Room 641A, a small
corner space on the sixth floor controlled not by AT&T, but by the NSA.
Hidden behind the heavily secured orange door was the agency's war-
rantless listening post. Labeled SG3 (short for the cover name, Study
Group 3), the 24-by-48-foot room was small and compact, like an elec-
tronic nest. Entering through the white panels of the false ceiling were
clones of the cables containing the vast majority of all international and
domestic communications entering Folsom Street.
   Lining three walls of the bugging room were racks of high-tech elec-
tronic equipment. On one shelf sat several Juniper routers, including a
powerful M40e, used by Internet service providers to launch and manage
edge networks, and a Brocade Silk Worm 2800 switch for high-speed,
block-level access to e-mail servers and databases. There was a meta-
data cabinet; another for network management; and seven Sun computers,
servers, and data storage devices. But the piece of equipment that most
concerned the AT&T technician Mark Kline was the Narus STA 6400.
   In the summer of 2002, Kline had been assigned to the company's
Geary Street facility in San Francisco. "I was sitting at my workstation
one day, and some e-mail came in," he said. "I opened it up, and it was
just a notice saying that somebody from the National Security Agency,
NSA, was going to come visit for some business. They didn't say what,
of course . . . That struck me as a little odd to begin with, because I re-
member from back in the seventies, the NSA is not supposed to be doing


                                    189

                          B O O K T H R E E : C O O P E R A T I O N

domestic spying, so what were they doing in an AT&T company office?"
A few days later, the NSA employee turned up and Kline introduced him
to one of his colleagues, who was being processed for a Top Secret NSA
clearance.
   Then in January 2003, he and several other employees toured the com-
pany's giant switch on Folsom Street. "There I saw a new room being
built adjacent to the 4ESS switch room where the public's phone calls
are routed," he said. "I learned that the person whom the NSA inter-
viewed for the secret job was the person working to install equipment in
this room." Ten months later, Kline was transferred to the Folsom Street
switch, where he was put in charge of the WorldNet Internet room, one
floor above the secret NSA room. There, Kline took over responsibility
for installing new fiber-optic circuits and troubleshooting those already
in place.
  "As soon as I saw the splitter," Kline said, "I knew this was completely
unconstitutional and illegal because they were copying everything. I'm
a technician, I know what this equipment does, and I traced the cable.
This cable goes to that room, which we can't go into; that's a government
room. And I knew what was on that cable. The documents gave me the
list of sixteen entities whose data was being copied, and they were major
carriers, and not just AT&T, including major exchange points, like MAE
West. It was everything that went across the Internet then, which was Web
browsing and e-mail and VoIP calls. The circuits listed were the peering
links, which connect WorldNet with other networks and hence the whole
country, as well as the rest of the world."
   Kline also said that because they installed the taps in the AT&T facility
in downtown San Francisco rather than at the cable landing station, a key
target is domestic--not just international--traffic. "It struck me at the
time that from what I knew of the network, if you just wanted to get in-
ternational traffic, you would go to the cable stations and also the satellite
stations, and you get all the international traffic you want, without having
to mess it up with a whole bunch of domestic traffic that you would then
have to waste your time sifting out. And it struck me at the time that they
were putting this in places where they were bound to catch a lot of domes-
tic traffic . . . The implication is that they want domestic traffic."
   To Kline, there could be only one answer. "Based on my understanding
of the connections and equipment at issue," he said, "it appears the NSA


                                           190

                                 S P L I T T E R

is capable of conducting what amounts to vacuum-cleaner surveillance
of all the data crossing the Internet--whether that be people's e-mail,
Web surfing, or any other data . . . What I saw is that everything's flowing
across the Internet to this government-controlled room. The physical ap-
paratus gives them everything. A lot of this was domestic."
  When Kline retired, he took with him a stack of internal AT&T papers.
"One of the documents listed the equipment installed in the secret room,"
he said, "and this list included a Narus STA 6400, which is a `Semantic
Traffic Analyzer.' The Narus STA technology is known to be used par-
ticularly by government intelligence agencies because of its ability to sift
through large amounts of data looking for preprogrammed targets." Also
in the room was a Narus Logic Server.
   Like much of the equipment used for bugging, the Narus hardware
and software was originally designed for a different purpose. With the
growth of the Internet and digital communications, data began flowing
over fiber-optic lines in "packets." The only way a company can deter-
mine exactly whom to bill for how much time is being used or how many
megabytes are being sent is to analyze those millions of packets as they
flow from the incoming cables to the routers at the speed of light. Thus,
as the e-mail from Surabaya zaps through the room and onto a Sprint
router, the Narus equipment can record its details--known as "metadata."
With this information, AT&T can charge Sprint and Sprint is then reim-
bursed by the subscriber in Cincinnati.
   Following the attacks on 9/11, Narus began modifying its system and
selling it to intelligence agencies around the world, who used it not for
billing purposes but for mass surveillance. Their top-of-the-line product
became the secretive NarusInsight Intercept Suite, which the company
claims is "the leader in carrier-class security and traffic intelligence for
the world's largest IP networks."
   The Intercept Suite, according to Narus, is "the industry's only net-
work traffic intelligence system that supports real-time precision target-
ing, capturing and reconstruction of webmail traffic. Narus technology
has long been recognized for its ability to identify and track almost all
network and application protocols across very large networks. Targeting
and capturing webmail traffic is a difficult challenge due to the propri-
etary and frequent changing nature of webmail services being monitored.
The NarusInsight Intercept Suite (NIS) has solved this problem and is


                                     191

                        B O O K T H R E E : C O O P E R A T I O N

now capable of precision targeting, capturing and reconstructing numer-
ous aspects of webmail traffic including email, chat, calendaring, draft
folders, address books and much more. Traffic from all nodes and numer-
ous protocols can be reassembled and viewed from a single management
station or distributed across multiple stations. In addition, NIS supports a
large percentage of all webmail services, including Google Gmail, MSN
Hotmail, Yahoo! Mail, and Gawab Mail (English and Arabic versions)."
   At the heart of the Intercept Suite is the NarusInsight computer, an
enormously powerful machine capable of scanning the fastest transmis-
sion lines on the Internet, including OC-192 cables that carry 10 gigabits
per second--10 billion bits of information per second. It can also carry
almost 130,000 simultaneous telephone calls. According to the company,
the Intercept Suite "uniquely provides insight into the entire network, en-
suring that all targeted data is captured regardless of the size, speed, or
asymmetric topology of the network. Any number of links, at any speed,
with any routing architecture, can be simultaneously monitored." (Em-
phasis in original.)
  "Anything that comes through [an Internet protocol network], we can
record," boasts the company's vice president of marketing, Steve Ban-
nerman. "We can reconstruct all of their e-mails along with attachments,
see what Web pages they clicked on, we can reconstruct their [Voice over
Internet Protocol] calls." Adds company CEO Greg Oslan, "The latest
iteration of NIS follows a long line of powerful and unique products de-
veloped by Narus and once again raises the bar, providing unparalleled
monitoring and intercept capabilities to service providers and govern-
ment organizations around the world."
   In its promotional literature to intelligence agencies, Narus claims it
has the ability to analyze an astronomical number of records. "Narus is
the recognized performance leader," it says, "with production environ-
ments exceeding 10 billion records per day, for global applications in
wireless, WiFi, prepaid, broadband, voice and data."
   To help ensure future contracts with the NSA, in September 2004 Na-
rus appointed William P. Crowell, a former deputy director of the agency,
to its board. Before becoming the agency's top civilian, Crowell had
served as head of its signals intelligence operations. The Narus website
also sheds light on additional qualities unique to its product:




                                         192

                                 S P L I T T E R

   One distinctive capability that Narus is known for is its ability to
   capture and collect data from the largest networks around the world.
   To complement this capability, Narus provides analytics and report-
   ing products that have been deployed by its customers worldwide.
   They involve powerful parsing algorithms, data aggregation and fil-
   tering for delivery to various upstream and downstream operating
   and support systems. They also involve correlation and association
   of events collected from numerous sources, received in multiple for-
   mats, over many protocols, and through different periods of time.


   By placing the Narus equipment in the secret room at AT&T, the NSA
was spreading an electronic drift net across cyberspace. As data from the
cables raced by at mega-Gbps speed, packets containing target names,
addresses, key words, and phrases would be kicked out and forwarded
to the NSA for further analysis. Among those who understand Narus's
capabilities, as well as its dangers, is Dr. Brian Reid, the former scientist
at Bell Labs, who also taught electrical engineering at Stanford and was
a member of the team that built the first Cisco router.
   "The Narus box allows you to find what you're looking for," said Reid.
"It is a sifter--and its purpose is to winnow the information down to a
low enough rate that it could be pumped to the other end of the wire,
which we assume is the NSA. If they had enough capacity to deliver the
information from the place where it was wiretapped to the place they
were going to use it, they wouldn't need the Narus. Its only purpose is
real-time sifting. And if you don't filter, then you have an information
overload and you don't know what to send. They needed the Narus to
know what to send. The Narus is an empty vessel waiting to be given
instructions, and the hardware is simply a large number of parallel filters
all of which can be programmed at once. It watches the data go by and
compares what it sees to whatever it's been told to look for, and when it
sees a match it notifies its parent computer by saying `got one here,' and
the parent computer responds by grabbing the thing it just got and send-
ing it over the wire. All that could be done remotely--there's no need for
any human in that room."
   Reid added, "It looks at everything . . . Whatever question the NSA
is trying to answer, that determines what they put in there. And whether




                                     193

                         B O O K T H R E E : C O O P E R A T I O N

they put in key words or address partial matches--there's no limit. You
can look for whatever you want. And the thing that's great about the
Narus box is that it gives you the freedom to pattern match on anything.
So if you don't want to do key words, if you want to do a mixture of IP
addresses and who's your ISP and whether it contained the word `mother'
in all caps, it can do that too."
   Another expert familiar with Narus is J. Scott Marcus. One of the
country's foremost experts on the Internet, from July 2001 to July 2005
he served as the senior advisor for Internet technology at the Federal
Communications Commission. He analyzed Kline's documents and state-
ment as an expert witness for the Electronic Frontier Foundation in a suit
against AT&T over illegal surveillance. In his sworn declaration, he said
that "the Narus system is well suited to process huge volumes of data, in-
cluding user content, in real time. It is thus well suited to the capture and
analysis of large volumes of data for purposes of surveillance."
   Much of that "huge volume of data," according to Kline, came from
the interception of traffic from AT&T's peering partners, such as Sprint
and UUNET. And despite being turned down by Joe Nacchio, the NSA
nevertheless got access to Qwest's communications because of its peering
relationship with AT&T. Qwest's was among the cables placed through
the "splitter box." Just as the AT&T documents outlined in detail how to
tap into the cables, they also described which peering links to target. They
included ConXion, Verio, XO, Genuity, Qwest, PAIX, Allegiance, Abo-
venet, Global Crossing, C&W, UUNET, Level 3, Sprint, Telia, PSINet,
and MAE West. "It's not just WorldNet customers who are being spied
on--it's the entire Internet."
   Marcus, who holds a Top Secret clearance and has been a member
of the FCC's Homeland Security Policy Council, agreed that the peer-
ing companies were indeed a key NSA target. "All of the networks with
which AT&T peered in San Francisco had their traffic intercepted," he
said, adding, "any AT&T peering partners whose traffic was not inter-
cepted most likely were small networks that exchanged very little traffic
with AT&T. The traffic intercepted at the facility probably represented a
substantial fraction of AT&T's total national peering traffic."
   Looking at the entire NSA setup, Marcus came away greatly concerned.
He was especially surprised because it appeared that the system was not
limited to international traffic but included all domestic U.S. commu-


                                          194

                                   S P L I T T E R

nications as well--it all went into the secret room. The deployment, he
said, "apparently involves considerably more locations than would be
required to catch the majority of international traffic . . . This configura-
tion appears to have the capability to enable surveillance and analysis of
Internet content on a massive scale, including both overseas and purely
domestic traffic . . . I conclude that AT&T has constructed an extensive--
and expensive--collection of infrastructure that collectively has all the
capability necessary to conduct large scale covert gathering of IP-based
communications information, not only for communications to overseas
locations, but for purely domestic communications as well." (Emphasis

   Secret cooperation with the telecom industry is only one method the
NSA uses to penetrate the Internet and fiber-optic communications. Long
before the warrantless eavesdropping program was inaugurated follow-
ing the 9/11 attacks, the agency was covertly tapping into both. This
was revealed in a highly classified closed-door discussion at the NSA
on September 30, 1999, between the NSA deputy director for services
Terry Thompson and members of the agency's technical workforce. "The
projections that we made five, six, eight years ago," said Thompson in a
videotape of the meeting obtained by the author, "about the increasing
volumes of collection and what that's going to mean for our analysts have
all come true, thanks in large part to the work that you all and others have
done. We're much further ahead now in terms of being able to access and
collect [Internet] network data, fiber optics, cellular data, all the different
modalities of communications that we are targeting."
   One of the ways to covertly penetrate both the Internet and fiber-op-
tic communications is to target their weakest point, the point where the
systems interconnect--the routers. Literally the heart of the Internet, they
are the specialized microcomputers that link two or more incompatible
computer networks together. They also act as a sort of postal service,
deciding where to route the various messages carried over the network.
"Virtually all Internet traffic travels across the system of one company:
Cisco Systems," says a Cisco television ad. By discovering the weak
spots and vulnerabilities in this "postal service," the NSA has the ability
to target and intercept much of the electronic mail.
   Thus, as Thompson further explained at the 1999 meeting, one of the
NSA's goals should be to hire away, on a short-term basis, people from


                                       195

                       B O O K T H R E E : C O O P E R A T I O N

key companies such as Cisco. Having hired them, the agency could use
their knowledge and expertise to "reverse engineer" the systems and find
ways to install back doors. "I only need this person to do reverse engi-
neering on Cisco routers," he said, "for about three or five years, because
I see Cisco going away as a key manufacturer for routers and so I don't
need that expertise. But I really need somebody today and for the next
couple of years who knows Cisco routers inside and out and can help me
understand how they're being used in target networks."
   While there had always been movement back and forth between the
NSA and the corporate world, for the most part agency officials consid-
ered the work too sensitive to hand out to contractors. But that changed
in 2001 when Congress, worried that the NSA was falling far behind,
insisted that the agency expand its domain to the private sector. In its bud-
get authorization that year, the House Intelligence Committee listed fiber-
optic communications and the Internet as among the key problem areas
facing the NSA and recommended more outsourcing to the corporate
world. "During the 1980s budget increases," said the committee, "NSA
decided to build up its in-house government scientists and engineers and
the agency now seems to believe that in-house talent can address the
rapidly evolving signals environment better than outsiders can . . . The
culture demanded compartmentation, valued hands-on technical work,
and encouraged in-house prototyping. It placed little value on program
management, contracting development work to industry, and the associ-
ated systems engineering skills."
   The committee decided it was time for a change. "Today, an entirely
new orientation is required," said the 2001 budget report. "The agency
must rapidly enhance its program management and systems engineering
skills and heed the dictates of these disciplines, including looking at op-
tions to contract out for these skills." According to Mike Hayden, "The
explosive growth of the global network and new technologies make our
partnership with industry more vital to NSA's success than ever before."
As a result, in a troubling change, much of the NSA's highly sensitive
eavesdropping has been outsourced to private firms in the same way it
outsources copy machine repair.

T  he NSA's new willingness to outsource eavesdropping, plus the war-
   rantless eavesdropping and other new programs, thus became a giant
boon to a growing fraternity of contractors who make their living off the
NSA. Headquarters for what might be termed the surveillance-industrial
complex is the National Business Park, "NBP" in NSA lingo. Located
just across the Baltimore-Washington Parkway from the agency's secret
city, it is nearly as secret and nearly as protected as the agency itself. The
centerpiece is NBP-1, a tall glass office building belonging to the NSA's
Technology and Systems Organization.
   Stretching out below NBP-1, hidden from the highway and surrounded
by tall trees, National Business Park is a large compound of buildings
owned by the NSA's numerous high-tech contractors. The NSA's prob-
lem is trying to keep up with the enormous volume of incoming informa-
tion, including the warrantless monitoring, which, like any system when
restraints are removed, tends to expand exponentially. NBP fills the need
as a sort of private-sector NSA.
  Among the companies with large, heavily protected buildings at NBP
is Booz Allen with a 250,000-square-foot mausoleum. The company
has long had very close ties to the NSA, especially since former director
Mike McConnell left the agency in February 1996 to become a vice presi-
dent and earn a $2-million-a-year salary. "At the National Business Park
Campus, we apply Tomorrow's Technology Today," says the company's
website, to deliver "Signals Intelligence Solutions to the government and


                                      197

private sector." Then, using head-hunting firms, it advertises for such po-
sitions as Internet eavesdroppers. One ad listed the job title as "Network
Intelligence Analyst" and gave a description of the job:


·  Provide network intelligence analysis support within multiple SIGINT
   development offices to high-profile government clients for a rapidly
   growing team.


·  Provide wide range of network analysis, including basic research, pro-
   tocol analysis, and network topology mapping of traffic through dif-
   ferent layers of the OSI model and report the results of the analysis.


·  Perform basic network and user discovery using various techniques,
   including domain name IP mapping, NS lookup, trace route analysis,
   and the analysis of network information, including operating systems
   and hosts from IP, TCP, and UDP headers.


   Basic Qualifications:


   ·  3+ years of experience with intelligence analysis
   ·  Knowledge of the TCP/IP protocols
   ·  Ability to perform basic protocol and network analyses
   ·  TS/SCI clearance


   Additional Qualifications:


   ·  BA or BS degree in a related field
   ·  Experience with advanced telecommunications, LAN, WAN,
      routers, data communications, and connectivity
   ·  Experience with SIGINT and intelligence analysis
   ·  Knowledge of data and telephony networking
   ·  Knowledge of basic data flow, including the OSI model and
      router, hub, and switched communications
   ·  Experience with UNIX, including writing and modifying scripts
      for text data manipulation
   ·  Possession of excellent technical writing skills

   Clearance:


   Applicants selected will be subject to a security investigation and may
   need to meet eligibility requirements for access to classified informa-
   tion; TS/SCI clearance is required.


   Another Booz Allen listing was for a "SIGINT Network Analyst" and
described the duties as possibly including monitoring phone calls. The
person selected, said the ad, would "evaluate and analyze complex data
and telecommunications networks within SIGINT offices for high-pro-
file government clients." It's a competitive field. SAIC also advertises
for network intelligence analysts, and another firm, SPARTA, was look-
ing for a "Digital Network Intelligence Analyst . . . to pursue access and
exploitation of targets of interest."
   Making up the surveillance-industrial empire are both high-profile
Wall Street giants and little-known industrial park dwarfs. What they have
in common is great profits from the NSA's very deep pockets--more
than ever since the start of the post-9/11 eavesdropping boom. By 2007,
excluding the military, the intelligence community's budget was $43.5
billion, about a third larger than during the pre-9/11 years. Adding in the
military and tactical intelligence budget brought the total to about $60
billion.
   With the billions pouring in, Hayden launched the largest recruiting
drive in the agency's history. In 2003, the agency's recruiters logged
more than 290,000 miles on 268 recruiting trips to 102 schools in forty-
four states and one territory. The efforts produced 820 new employees in
2002, another 1,125 in 2003, and 1,500 in 2004. By 2008, 40 percent of
the NSA's workforce had been hired since 2001.
   At the same time Hayden was building his empire within Fort Meade,
he was also creating a shadow NSA: of the $60 billion going to the intelli-
gence community, most of it--about $42 billion, an enormous 70 percent--
was going to outside contractors. To some inside the agency, it seemed that
any idea, no matter how pie-in-the-sky, regardless of its impracticality in
the real world, got funded. The numbers told the story. In October 2001,
the NSA had 55 contracts let out to 144 contractors. But by October 2005,
the agency had 7,197 contracts and 4,388 active contractors.

                        B O O K T H R E E : C O O P E R A T I O N

   Quick to get their share were the usual wingtip Goliaths, Booz Allen,
L-3 Communications, Lockheed Martin, SAIC, and Northrop Grumman.
Once focused primarily on management strategy for corporate board-
rooms in Manhattan skyscrapers, Booz Allen realized that as the gov-
ernment slimmed down, they had a great opportunity to fatten up. Thus,
in 1992 they moved their headquarters to Tysons Corner, Virginia. Now
more than half of the company's $4 billion a year comes from the U.S.
Treasury. And since 2000, Booz Allen's revenue has doubled. It is also
the size of a city; in 2007 the company planned to increase its workforce
of eighteen thousand by another four thousand. Among the surveillance
projects in which the company has been heavily involved was John Poin-
dexter's Total Information Awareness program.
   Like the military-industrial complex warned of by President Dwight D.
Eisenhower, the surveillance-industrial complex that has grown up since
2001 is a cozy club made up of business executives with close, expen-
sive contractual ties to the NSA. A quick-turning revolving door allows
frequent movement between the agency and industry as senior officials
trade their blue NSA badges for green badges worn by contractors. As
with Booz Allen, many firms have discovered that the fastest way into
the NSA's cipher-locked door is by hiring a former director or other top
executive.
   Thus SPARTA hired Maureen Baginski, the NSA's powerful signals
intelligence director, in October 2006 as president of its National Secu-
rity Systems Sector. Applied Signal Technology put John P. Devine, the
agency's former deputy director for technology and systems, on its board
of directors. Likewise, TRW hired the former NSA director William
Studeman, a retired navy admiral, to be vice president and deputy general
manager for intelligence programs. Cylink, a major company involved
in encryption products, hired McConnell's former deputy director, Wil-
liam P. Crowell, as vice president. Crowell had been through the revolv-
ing door before, going from a senior executive position at the NSA to a
vice presidency at Atlantic Aerospace Electronics Corporation, an agency
contractor, and back to the NSA as chief of staff. Another deputy director
of the agency, Charles R. Lord, left the NSA and immediately became a
vice president at E Systems, one of the NSA's biggest contractors.
   With about forty-four thousand employees each, SAIC and NSA are
both heavyweights, and they have a decidedly incestuous relationship.

After first installing the former NSA director Bobby Inman on its board,
SAIC then hired top agency official William B. Black Jr. as a vice presi-
dent following his retirement in 1997. Then Mike Hayden hired him back
to be the agency's deputy director in 2000. Two years later SAIC won
the $280 million Trailblazer contract to help develop the agency's next-
generation eavesdropping architecture, which Black managed. Another
official spinning back and forth between the company and the agency
was Samuel S. Visner. From 1997 to 2001 he was SAIC's vice president
for corporate development. He then moved to Fort Meade as the NSA's
chief of signals intelligence programs and two years later returned as a
senior vice president and director of SAIC's strategic planning and busi-
ness development within the company's intelligence group.
   For many years, the surveillance-industrial complex was managed
from a white two-story office building at 141 National Business Park, just
down the street from the NSA's NBP 1. Behind the double doors to Suite
112 was a little-known organization called the Security Affairs Support
Association (SASA), which, since its founding in 1980, had served as the
bridge between the intelligence and industrial communities. From 1999
to 2002, SASA's president was Lieutenant General Kenneth A. Minihan,
who retired as director of the NSA in 1999. Its executive vice president
for many years was retired air force major general John E. Morrison Jr., a
former head of operations at the NSA and long one of the most respected
people in the intelligence community.
   In 2003, with an influx of money as a result of the post-9/11 intel-
ligence boom, the organization changed its name to the Intelligence and
National Security Alliance (INSA). It also moved closer to the centers of
power, establishing itself in a nondescript building in Ballston, a nexus
between the intelligence agencies, the Pentagon, and the contractors.
Once a year, first as SASA and now as INSA, the organization holds the
spy world's equivalent of the Oscars when it hosts the William Oscar
Baker Award Dinner. The gala black-tie event attracts the Who's Who of
both the intelligence community and the contractors seeking their money.
"The effectiveness of the U.S. intelligence and national security commu-
nities depends on strong relationships within the industry," said the for-
mer NSA director McConnell, a member of SASA and then chairman of
INSA before being named director of national intelligence.
   For decades, the local business community viewed the NSA mostly


                                     201

                         B O O K T H R E E : C O O P E R A T I O N

with suspicion. It was a secretive Goliath that ate up a great deal of
electricity but mostly kept to itself. But following the 9/11 attacks and
Hayden's wild spending spree, the county quickly saw dollar signs and
wanted to get in on the action. With Hayden's blessing and encourage-
ment, county officials and local business leaders got together to create an
industrial "incubator" for the agency called the Chesapeake Innovation
Center. The idea was to establish a county-funded magnet that would
attract scores of high-tech start-up firms seeking to invent a better signal
trap and then sell it to the NSA. A brochure created by the CIC to attract
the companies pointed out that wiretapping was the wave of the future.
"Wiretapping activity--the capturing of communications made by sus-
pected terrorists or criminals," said the glossy twenty-three-page booklet,
"will grow 20­25% per year as new high-speed data and packet-based
networks generate incremental demand for wiretapping software. This
market is at historically high levels."
   Excited local business leaders soon began hoping the center might be a
way to turn the Baltimore­Washington corridor into the Silicon Valley of
eavesdroppers. "Tech leaders want NSA to become Greater Baltimore's
National Institutes of Health," gushed one article, "a government research
facility that fuels the formation of a critical mass of high-tech companies,
much the way NIH played a big role in spawning Montgomery County's
bioscience cluster . . . NSA riches are flowing to local firms. Columbia's
Raba Technologies landed a contract in August potentially worth $100
million for signals intelligence work." One local businessman boasted,
"We're just scratching the surface with NSA."
   The Fort Meade area had become a Klondike for data miners. But like
many promising mines during the Gold Rush, the CIC incubator, housed
in a pricey, brick-and-glass building at 175 Admiral Cochrane Drive in
Annapolis, came up largely empty. The facility quickly began filling its
twenty-seven thousand square feet of floor space but few tenants had any-
thing useful to sell. The first year the incubator lost $60,000, the second
$457,000, and the third between $150,000 and $200,000. By 2007, the
CIC was forced to collapse its organization to one-fifth its original size,
reducing its floor space to just 5,400 square feet.
   The problems that led to 9/11, however, were never a lack of money
or technology. During the late 1990s, on Hayden's watch, there were few
targets as important as the Yemen ops center. It was known to be con-


                                          202

                                  I N D U S T R Y

nected to both the African embassy bombings and the USS Cole attacks
as well as serving as bin Laden's communications hub--with hundreds
of calls to him and from him. Yet for nearly a year the agency intercepted
phone calls between the house in Yemen and the suspected terrorists in
San Diego without ever discovering their city code or even country code.
With an annual pre-9/11 budget of more than $4 billion a year, and a
constellation of satellites and listening posts around the world, obtaining
that metadata should have been well within the agency's capabilities. If it
wasn't, there was something seriously wrong with the agency.
   By late 2003, many in the Republican Congress began seeing Hayden's
bills and were stunned at the number of zeros before the decimal points.
Few had ever witnessed such reckless spending with so little to show for
it. Thus, in a highly unusual move, they snatched away his checkbook
and credit cards, stripping him of his acquisition authority. From then
on, if the agency needed new pencils, he would have to requisition them
from Pentagon auditors with green eyeshades and the key to the cashbox.
"We want to make sure that taxpayers get the intelligence systems that are
needed at the best possible cost," said a spokesman for Senator John W.
Warner, the Virginia Republican who headed the Senate Armed Services
Committee, which led the push for the legislation. "Speed is important,
but getting the right systems at the right cost is just as important, and they
are not mutually exclusive." It was a rebuke to Hayden, but his career still
seemed headed straight up.
   As the founder of SASA, sixty-five-year-old Leonard Moodispaw might
be considered the father of the surveillance-industrial complex. Tall and
balding with rimless glasses and a white mustache, the thirteen-year NSA
veteran was the CEO of Essex Corporation, one of the many secretive
NSA contractors at NBP whose profits had exploded since the start of the
warrantless eavesdropping program. A key reason was Essex's specialty:
fiber optics. Moodispaw has a hearty laugh and a penchant for loud floral
prints. He does not fit the bland stereotype of an electronic eavesdrop-
per; a self-proclaimed Jimmy Buffett "Parrothead," he has stuffed parrots
hanging from the ceiling in his lobby and calls himself a "flaming liberal."
"I refuse to use Reagan's name unless I'm throwing up," he says. And
he's not too fond of George W. Bush either. "The Bush administration is
a very vindictive organization," he scowls.
   First established in 1969, Essex spent its first several decades engaged


                                      203

                        B O O K T H R E E : C O O P E R A T I O N

in human factors research--exploring the pros and cons of such things as
a third rear stoplight on automobiles. But sales were slow and the outlook
grim--until the company hired Moodispaw, who brought in others from
the agency and placed the company inside the NSA's rarefied orbit. In
2000 Moodispaw was named CEO and the next year the company's prof-
its were soaring past 400 percent. One of thousands of companies on the
NSA's contractor base, Essex was among the elite 30 percent who were
regularly awarded competition-free no-bid contracts. Also like many of
the others, Essex was the NSA in microcosm. Its name was virtually un-
known beyond the secret city and its NBP suburb; most employees had
superhigh NSA clearances and lived in Laurel or one of the surrounding
towns; and its office was a high-security SCIF.
   In contrast to Booz Allen and the other giants in the NBP, Essex was
representative of the many smaller companies that also populated the of-
fice park. Rather than the thousands of contracts with the agency that a
company like SAIC might have, the small firms would have maybe a
dozen, and they would usually be narrowly focused. Also, many of the
smaller NSA contractors tended to be made up largely of former NSA
employees. At Essex, for example, James J. Devine, the executive vice
president, was formerly the NSA's deputy director for support services,
and his predecessor, Stephen E. Tate, was chief of the NSA's Strategic
Directions Team. Terry Turpin, the company's chief technology officer,
had headed the agency's advanced processing technologies division, and
the former NSA director Ken Minihan serves as advisor to the company.
   While the company had a seven-thousand-square-foot office at NBP,
its main laboratory was a few miles away in the company's large SCIF.
There, a key focus was developing ways to pack ever more data into
cables--phone calls, Internet packets, and imagery--without expand-
ing their physical size. At the same time, because of the sensitivity of
the information, a way had to be found to scramble the photons with
an all-optical encryption device. Such technologies are essential for the
NSA to securely transfer massive volumes of data from the point of col-
lection to the point of analysis. One system Essex was working on was
hyperfine WDM technology. According to Chris Donaghey, an analyst
with SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, "At its most promising, Essex's opti-
cal networking capability can improve the current amount of data on a
fiber-optic cable by a factor of one thousand." The company's first patent


                                         204

                                   I N D U S T R Y

for the technology, awarded on August 19, 2003, was intriguingly titled
"Optical Tapped Delay Line."
   Once the mega-volumes of data are transmitted through the cable, the
NSA has to find ways to process it. For that, Essex was exploring a vari-
ety of optical signal-processing techniques--a method that actually dates
back to Bletchley Park in England during World War II. British code
breakers used optical signal processing to solve the enormously complex
German cipher machine called Enigma. Today, it allows the NSA to pro-
cess mountains of information at mind-numbing speeds.
   Like most anything else in the arcane world of the supercomputer, op-
tical signal processing has its own unique unit of measurement when it
comes to speed. It is known as a "flop," for floating point operations per
second. Thus, where it may take the average person several minutes to
calculate with a pencil the correct answer to a single multiplication prob-
lem, such as 0.0572 X 8762639.8765, supercomputers are measured by
how many times per second they can solve such problems. If it takes a
second to come up with the answer, including where to place the "float-
ing" decimal point, then the computer would be said to be operating at
one flop per second. A teraflop is a trillion operations a second.
   On a bench in Essex's lab was a 10-teraflop processor about the size
of a standard desktop. It ran, however, about ten thousand times faster, at
ten trillion operations a second. "We've developed a very sophisticated
test called the `holy shit test,' " said Moodispaw. "One day we had three
different sets of government customers come in to see what we could do.
They all said, `Holy shit, you can do that?' We're getting results nobody
else can on the technology side."
   Eavesdropping has become one of the hottest sectors in the market-
place. By 2005, Essex's revenue shot up to $159.8 million, more than
double that of the previous year and nearly ten times that of 2003. Profit
grew even faster, rising to $8.6 million from $2.3 million in 2004. As the
company skyrocketed, picking up another $47 million top-secret contract
from the NSA, Moodispaw took the company public and moved it into
a new thirty-nine-thousand-square-foot headquarters in Columbia and a
year later added another twenty-five thousand square feet. Like Pac-Man,
he also began gobbling up other smaller NSA contractors, such as Sen-
sys Development Laboratories Inc. and Windermere, whose CEO was
another former NSA deputy director, Raymond Tate. Then there were


                                       205

                        B O O K T H R E E : C O O P E R A T I O N

more acquisitions, including Adaptive Optics in Cambridge, Massachu-
setts, for $40.3 million.
   By 2006, Moodispaw's once tiny company had gone from fewer than
fifty people in 1969 to nearly a thousand employees, with revenue pro-
jections of $250 million to $260 million. It had become the fifth-fastest-
growing company in the Baltimore region, and the surveillance-industrial
complex continued to sizzle with no end in sight. Finally ripe for the
plucking, Essex itself was purchased at the premium price of $580 mil-
lion by Northrop Grumman, one of the giants in the surveillance world.
"For our shareholders," said Moodispaw at the end of his short but very
profitable ride, "we have increased the enterprise value of the company
from less than $20 million in 2000 to approximately $580 million un-
der the proposed acquisition." It was a price Northrop Grumman could
easily afford; a month before its announcement, in October 2006, the
NSA awarded the company a $220 million contract for a massive, new
advanced information management and data storage system. At the NBP,
as champagne corks flew in both neighboring companies, the business of
tapping had become one of America's leading growth industries.
   There was no celebration on the other side of the continent, however.
As Mark Kline studied his schematics of the peering connections, and
the splitter cabinet, and the cloned cable, and the secret room, he had
one more shock coming. "I was talking to a technician on the phone
back east," he said, "and I was trying to troubleshoot a problem because I
couldn't get the splitter to work right. This technician tells me, `Oh, yeah,
we're having the same problem with the splitters going into other offices.'
My hair just stood on end when the person said that. And I said, `Other
offices?' And she said, `Yeah, in Seattle and San Diego and Los Angeles
and San Jose,' all having the same problem . . . From all the connections
I saw, they were basically sweeping up, vacuum-cleaning the Internet
through all the data, sweeping it all into this secret room . . . It's the sort
of thing that very intrusive, repressive governments would do, finding
out about everybody's personal data without a warrant. I knew right away
that this was illegal and unconstitutional, and yet they were doing it."

I n addition to communications to and from the U.S., broad streams of
  telecommunications that transit the country are another key target of
the NSA--calls and e-mails from one part of the world to another that
simply pass through a U.S. switch. It is a greatly increasing phenomenon,
making up about one-third of all communications entering and leaving
the country, and one NSA has quietly been attempting to encourage. One
of the agency's "greatest advantages," said Lieutenant General Keith B.
Alexander, Hayden's successor as director of the NSA, was "the ability
to access a vast portion of the world's communications infrastructure lo-
cated in our own nation."
   The problem for Hayden was that although the people he was targeting
were foreigners in a foreign country communicating with foreigners in
another foreign country, because the signal was on a cable--a wire--the
FISA court consistently ruled that he must first obtain a warrant. "The
issue was international communications are on a wire," said Director of
National Intelligence Mike McConnell, "so all of a sudden we were in a
position, because of the wording in the law, that we had to have a warrant
to do that . . . Now if it were wireless, we would not be required to get a
warrant . . . We haven't done that in wireless [satellite communications]
for years." He added, "If Osama bin Laden in Pakistan call[ed] somebody
in Singapore, and it passed through the United States, they had to have a
warrant." Indeed, today most domestic and international communications




                                     207

                       B O O K T H R E E : C O O P E R A T I O N

at one point pass through a wire, such as a buried or undersea fiber-optic
cable.
   McConnell gave a preview of the cumbersome process now required
when foreign-to-foreign communication is intercepted over a cable. "It
takes about two hundred man-hours to do one telephone number," he said.
"Think about it from the judges' standpoint. `Well, is this foreign intelli-
gence? Well, how do you know it's foreign intelligence? Well, what does
Abdul calling Mohammed mean, and how do I interpret that?' So, it's a
very complex process. And now you've got to write it all up and it goes
through the signature process, take it through the Justice Department, and
take it down to the FISA court. So all that process is about two hundred
man-hours for one number."
   One example might be a person in Tokyo sending an e-mail at three in
the afternoon to someone in Beijing--a very busy, and expensive, time
for the message to pass through an Asian switch. As a result, the ISP
in Tokyo might instead automatically route all messages to Beijing at
that hour via AT&T's WorldNet switch in San Francisco, or one of its
peering partners there. At ten in the evening West Coast time, the com-
munications traffic in San Francisco would be greatly reduced, and thus
lessen the chance for a delay. Also, the off-peak time would provide a
significant price break. Because the communications travel at the speed
of light, and since both Japan­U.S. and China­U.S. fiber-optic cables
pass through the San Luis Obispo landing station, there would be no time
delay caused by the extra ten thousand or so miles.
   The same principle would be true for European and Middle Eastern
communications connecting through U.S. East Coast switches. A call
from Yemen to Pakistan might pass through MAE East in Virginia or the
60 Broad Street "carrier hotel" in New York City. A call from Madrid to
Beijing might also transit both MAE East and MAE West as it crosses
North America. Cost has always been a factor helping the NSA in this
regard. Pricing models, established by the International Telecommunica-
tions Union, have largely remained unchanged since they were estab-
lished over a century ago. Based on those tariffs, smaller, less developed
countries charge more to accept calls than U.S.-based carriers, providing
a cost incentive to route phone calls through the U.S. rather than directly
to a nearby country.
   Another incentive for the NSA is America's advanced telecommunica-


                                        208

                                  T R A N S I T

tions infrastructure. According to Ethan Zuckerman, a computer expert
at Harvard's Berkman Center who has spent a great deal of time working
on technology issues in Africa, a large share of even local intra-African
communications passes through U.S. switches due to the lack of local
ISPs. "Because the Internet access terminates on a different continent,"
he said, "it's likely that two people in the same African city communicat-
ing via e-mail are routing their packets through the U.S., traveling tens of
thousands of kilometers out of the way to have a chat across town." Mc-
Connell, pleased to see America become the world's switchboard, agreed.
"Today a single communication can transit the world even if the two peo-
ple communicating are only a few miles apart," he said. That may be true
even if the two people are in the same city in the U.S., according to the
former NSA deputy director Bill Crowell. "I have seen a communication
that went from Memphis to Pakistan to Japan to whatever in order to get
to another phone in Memphis," he said.
   Like those from Africa, nearly all Latin American communications,
internal and external, pass through a U.S. hub. It's a phenomenon with
which Alan Mauldin, a researcher for the firm TeleGeography, which
tracks global Internet traffic, is very familiar. "The U.S. does continue
to play a major role in connecting the regions of the world together," he
said. "For example, Internet traffic going between Latin America and
Asia or Latin America and Europe is entirely routed through the U.S."
Mauldin said that in 2005, an estimated 94 percent of that "interregional"
traffic passed through U.S. switches. "Basically they backhaul to the
United States, do the switch, and haul it back down since it's cheaper
than crossing their international borders," said Bill Manning, a member
of the research staff at USC's Information Sciences Institute and manag-
ing partner of ep.net.
   That Latin American traffic--millions of calls and e-mails an hour--is
funneled through a single building at 50 N.E. Ninth Street in Miami. Oc-
cupying an entire square block on the edge of the downtown area, the
pastel-colored six-story structure bears no signs, no name, and no win-
dows--just painted facsimiles. On its roof are three massive satellite
dishes hidden in golf-ball-like white radomes. A 750,000-square-foot
telecom fortress, it has seven-inch-thick, steel-reinforced concrete walls,
numerous hidden cameras, and biometric-controlled security portals. The
building was even designed to withstand a Category 5 hurricane, with


                                     209

                         B O O K T H R E E : C O O P E R A T I O N

nineteen million pounds of concrete roof ballast. From the outside, it
could easily be mistaken for an NSA building at Fort Meade.
   Known as the "NAP [National Access Point] of the Americas," like
MAE East and MAE West it is one of the country's major Internet Ex-
change Points. According to Norm Laudermilch, one of the executives
of Terremark, which owns the facility, "about 90 percent of the traffic
between North and South America goes through our facility in Miami."
The building also serves as a crossroads for communications heading for
Europe and beyond. "Switching the majority of South America, Central
America and the Caribbean's layer-1, layer-2 and layer-3 traffic bound to
more than 148 countries in the world," says its sales literature, "makes the
NAP of the Americas the unrivaled gateway to the Americas."
   From cities and towns throughout Latin America, the calls and Internet
traffic are funneled to landing stations linked to South America Crossing
(SAC), a large cable that circles the continent and is owned by Global
Crossing. At Hamm's Bay, St. Croix, in the U.S. Virgin Islands, SAC feeds
all this data into another of the company's cables, Mid-Atlantic Crossing
(MAC), which serves Central America and the Caribbean. After coming
ashore at a landing station in Hollywood, Florida, one branch continues
on to New York and then Europe. The other travels underground from
the beach in Hollywood to the NAP of the Americas building in Miami,
where Global Crossing is colocated. Thus, with a setup similar to San
Francisco's in place at NAP of the Americas, the NSA would have access
to virtually all communications in South America, Central America, and
the Caribbean, internal and external--one-stop shopping.
   The actual setup of the interception would be easy since under an
agreement with the government, Global Crossing was forced to engi-
neer its facility to be surveillance friendly--readily accessible to federal
eavesdropping operations. Known as a "Network Security Agreement,"
required in order for the company to obtain its landing license, Global
Crossing promised to provide a capability at its location "from which
Electronic Surveillance can be conducted pursuant to Lawful U.S. Pro-
cess." The company also agreed to "provide technical or other assistance
to facilitate such Electronic Surveillance" to, among other organizations,
the Defense Department, the NSA's parent.
   The agreement took advantage of a federal statute passed in 1994
known as CALEA--the Communications Assistance for Law Enforce-


                                          210

                                  T R A N S I T

ment Act. The law requires communications companies to engineer their
facilities so that their network can easily be monitored. It even requires
the company to install the eavesdropping devices themselves if necessary,
and then never reveal their existence. According to the statute, the gov-
ernment is required to first provide a warrant from a federal judge--one
from the FISA court, for example. But under the Bush administration's
warrantless surveillance program, they presumably could simply order
the company to comply.
  With its virtual alligator clips secure on the great American trunk line,
by 2002 the NSA was ingesting about 650 million intercepts a day--
voice and data--the same as the number of pieces of mail delivered every
day across the country by the U.S. Postal Service.

A   s the agency wired the country, it was no less concerned with the rest
    of the world. For forty years, the Echelon infrastructure had been
in place and worked well. Countries would communicate, their signals
would be transmitted to a satellite, and the NSA or one of its counter-
parts in Canada, Britain, Australia, or New Zealand would catch them.
Other signals would be captured by the NSA's geostationary satellites,
positioned like sentries at four points over the earth. Once the phone
and Internet data was captured, it would be run through "Dictionaries,"
powerful computers loaded with watch-listed phone numbers, names, ad-
dresses, words, and phrases. Based on that greatly reduced end product,
reports would be written and sent to the NSA and other members of the
Five Eyes group.
  But now that at least 80 to 90 percent of communications were transit-
ing the seabed instead of outer space, Echelon needed to be completely
revamped. Each member had to work out a secret arrangement with its re-
spective cable companies, secret rooms had to be built, cables needed to
be spliced into, data had to be backhauled to analysis centers, and faster
processing facilities had to be constructed. In addition, because some of
the critical connections were beyond reach of the members--no longer
could they just plant a dish on a remote island--new secret partnerships
had to be worked out with countries along cable routes.
  In countries where no cooperation could be obtained, the NSA or one
of its partners would have to surreptitiously recruit someone at a telecom


                                   212

                                  P A R T N E R S

switch to install a bug, or, as a last resort, attempt to physically tap the
fiber-optic cable itself. "The best way to do it is to get in the switching
station on the land. Find out where they are, bribe whoever you have to
bribe, get access," said one knowledgeable intelligence official. One key
problem when tapping any cable, he said, is not knowing what's going
over it until going to all the trouble of gaining access to it. "Sometimes
we don't know what's on them, we don't know what the traffic is, so our
intelligence, in terms of telling you what's on the line, sometimes is good,
sometimes is terrible. So you may be facing a situation, you spend several
hundred million dollars in a year preparing to go do something and you
find out that the take sucks."
   Although tapping into underground fiber-optic lines is much more dif-
ficult than tapping into a copper cable, the technique has been perfected
by the NSA. For cables buried in foreign countries, the task of gaining
access to them was given to a unique covert organization named the Spe-
cial Collection Service (SCS), which combined the clandestine skills of
the CIA with the technical capabilities of the NSA. Its purpose is to put
sophisticated eavesdropping equipment--from bugs to parabolic anten-
nas--in difficult-to-reach places. It also attempts to target for recruitment
key foreign communications personnel, such as database managers, sys-
tems administrators, and IT specialists.
   The SCS is a key link in the NSA's transition from a traditional focus
on information "in motion" to information "at rest." Since the first trans-
atlantic intercept station was erected on Gillin farm in Houlton, Maine,
just before the close of World War I, Sigint has concentrated on inter-
cepting signals as they travel through the air or space. But as technol-
ogy makes that increasingly difficult and cost prohibitive, the tendency,
say senior intelligence officials, will be to turn instead to information
"at rest"--the vast quantity of information stored on computer databases,
discs, and hard drives. This may be done either remotely through cyber-
space or physically by the SCS.
   As encryption, fiber optics, the Internet, and other new technologies
make life increasingly difficult for the NSA's intercept operators and code
breakers, the SCS has greatly expanded and taken on an increasingly im-
portant role. "Yesterday's code clerk is today's systems administrator,"
said one very senior CIA official. The easiest way to a large amount of
secret information is to get into foreign databases, and the best way to do


                                      213

                        B O O K T H R E E : C O O P E R A T I O N

that is to recruit--through bribes or other offers--the people who man-
age the systems. Also, by bribing someone to plant bugs in the keyboards
or other vulnerable parts of a computer network, the NSA can intercept
messages before the cryptographic software has a chance to jumble the
text.
   The position of SCS chief alternates between NSA and CIA officials.
The service is headquartered in a heavily protected, three-hundred-acre
compound consisting of three boxy low-rise buildings with an odd, cir-
cular park walled in between them. Located at 11600 Springfield Road in
Laurel, Maryland, nine miles south of the NSA, the facility is disguised
as a tree-lined corporate campus. In front is a sign with the letters "CSSG"
that seems not to have any meaning. Inside, in what is known as "the live
room," the electronic environment of target cities is re-created in order to
test which antennas and receivers would be best for covert interception.
Elsewhere, bugs, receivers, and antennas are incorporated into every-
day objects so they can be smuggled into foreign countries. "Sometimes
that's a very small antenna and you try to sneak it in," said former CIA
director Stansfield Turner. "Sometimes the signal you're intercepting is
very small, narrow, limited range, and getting your antenna there is going
to be very difficult."
  While in some places the NSA or SCS has compromised a nation's
entire communications system by bribing an engineer or telecommuni-
cations official, in others much of the necessary eavesdropping can be
done from special rooms in U.S. embassies. But in difficult countries
clandestine SCS agents must sometimes fly in disguised as businesspeo-
ple and covertly implant the necessary eavesdropping equipment. The
person might bring into the target country a parabolic antenna disguised
as an umbrella. A receiver and satellite transmitter may be made to ap-
pear as a simple radio and laptop computer. The SCS official would then
camouflage and plant the equipment in a remote site somewhere along
the microwave's narrow beam--maybe in a tree in a wooded area or in
the attic of a rented farm house. The signals captured by the equipment
would be remotely retransmitted to a geostationary Sigint satellite, which
would then relay them to the NSA.
   In order to obtain access to fiber-optic cables in noncooperative or
hostile foreign countries, the SCS would trace the cable to a remote area
and then dig a trench to get access to it. Then the person would place an


                                         214

                                  P A R T N E R S

advanced "clip-on coupler" onto the cable. These commercially avail-
able devices, used to test fiber-optic systems, produce a microbend in
the cable that allows a small amount of light to leak through the polymer
cladding shell. The light can then be captured by a photon detector, a
transducer that converts the photons into an electrical signal. This then
connects to an optical/electrical converter that is plugged into a port on
a laptop fitted with software allowing for remote control. Packed with
super-long-life batteries, the entire system can be reburied with a camou-
flaged line running up a tree to an antenna disguised as branches. Signals
from the bug can then be transmitted to an NSA satellite while remote-
control instructions are broadcast back down to the computer. All of the
equipment needed is commercially available.
   To tap undersea fiber-optic cables in the Middle East and elsewhere,
the navy secretly renovated the Seawolf-class submarine USS Jimmy
Carter for such operations. In December 1999 Electric Boat was awarded
a $887 million contract to extensively modify the sub with a special forty-
five-meter-long section for "surveillance, mine warfare, special warfare,
payload recovery and advanced communications." The sub would likely
set down on the bottom over the cable while a special NSA team pulled
it aboard in the newly installed section, tapped into it, and returned it to
the bottom attached to a breakaway pod. A cable could then be covertly
laid from the pod to a hidden shore location for clandestine transmission
back to Fort Meade. The only problem is it hasn't yet worked. "Can't do
it--doesn't have the ability to tap in. Won't be able to for a long time, if
ever," said one knowledgeable intelligence official. "Tapping the cables
underwater is extremely hard. I mean, it's hard enough doing it on land,
but it's extremely hard to do it underwater. It's not like copper cable
where you just go out and put something on it."
   Fortunately for the NSA, industrial-strength cable tapping has always
been a big business for countries around the world--and the agency has
often been a beneficiary. In Britain, siphoning telegrams and later e-mail
from incoming and outgoing cables has a long tradition, and GCHQ and
the NSA have always been the closest of trading partners. In the 1960s,
all cable traffic entering and leaving the United Kingdom was scrutinized
by a special department of the post office, which controlled the cable
system. "On the morning after they have been sent or received," said one
report, "they are collected and sifted by a Post Office department con-


                                      215

                         B O O K T H R E E : C O O P E R A T I O N

cerned with security. Then any cables believed to be of special interest
are passed to the Security Services. They are studied there, copied if nec-
essary, and returned to the Post Office, which owns the former Cable and
Wireless Company. Cables passed through private companies--mainly
branches of foreign concerns operating in Britain--are collected in vans
or cars each morning and taken to the Post Office security department.
The probe is conducted under a special warrant, signed by a Secretary of
State under Section 4 of the Official Secrets Act and regularly renewed to
keep it valid." While communications technology has certainly changed
since the 1960s, there is no indication that either the British policy or
Section 4 of the Official Secrets Act has changed.
   Just as the NSA and GCHQ are now attempting to find ways into the
new world of fiber-optic cables, they faced similar challenges at the dawn
of the satellite age forty years earlier. It was a time of enormous change;
the U.S. and the UK would be directly connected for the first time, by
both satellite and undersea cable. In 1962 the British Post Office Satellite
Communications Station at Goonhilly Downs in Cornwall came online
and its ninety-foot satellite dish began tracking Telstar, the world's first
communications satellite. But because of Telstar's low orbit, commu-
nications could only be transmitted and received as the satellite passed
overhead every 158 minutes.
   The following year, the first submarine cable directly linking the two
countries was completed. Known as TAT-3, the cable ran from Tuck-
erton, New Jersey, to Widemouth Bay near Bude in Cornwall. Then in
April 1965, the first geostationary communications satellite, INTELSAT
1, nicknamed "Early Bird," was launched. At 22,300 miles in space over
the equator, it was able to maintain a fixed position between the two con-
tinents. This allowed, for the first time, direct and continuous communi-
cations between Goonhilly Downs and the U.S. satellite ground station
in Etam, West Virginia. Rapidly, other nations around the world began
building ground stations and communicating with one another via Early
Bird.
   GCHQ needed no help from the NSA obtaining the communications
coming over TAT-3. Since the UK end of the cable was under the control
of the post office, it simply obtained the traffic directly from them--pos-
sibly at a GCHQ facility near the Bude landing station. The cable was one
of the few communications links between countries in Europe and North


                                          216

                                 P A R T N E R S

America and therefore proved a rich source of intelligence. But now
much of Europe and beyond was bypassing England and communicating
directly through Early Bird to other parts of the world. Without satellite
dishes to intercept those signals, that widening stream of intelligence was
out of GCHQ's reach--until the NSA came to the rescue.
  At the time, the NSA was building its own satellite interception base at
Sugar Grove, West Virginia, about fifty miles from Early Bird's downlink
at Etam. Seeing the value in a worldwide network of such dishes--the
eventual Echelon operation--the NSA agreed to help finance and build
the station for GCHQ. The place chosen was Bude, possibly to place it
near an existing interception facility for the TAT-3 cable. Today Wide-
mouth Bay is the landing point for TAT-14 and a number of other major
fiber-optic cables.
   Once the two ninety-foot dishes at Bude were completed in the late
1960s, the director of GCHQ at the time, Sir Leonard Hooper, sent his
personal thanks to NSA director Marshall "Pat" Carter. In his note he
suggested that the original two dishes should be named after Carter and
his deputy, Louis Tordella. "I know that I have leaned shamefully on
you, and sometimes taken your name in vain, when I needed approval for
something at this end," Sir Leonard wrote. "The aerials at Bude ought to
be christened `Pat' and `Louis'!" Hooper added, "Between us, we have
ensured that the blankets and sheets are more tightly tucked around the
bed in which our two sets of people lie and, like you, I like it that way."
   Sitting high above the Celtic Sea on the edge of Sharpnose Point, Bude
today has nearly a dozen dishes pointed at various satellites, spanning
the Indian Ocean to the South Atlantic. Since the opening of the space
age, Goonhilly Downs had been a key link for Britain in satellite com-
munications. But in 2008 the station was closed down. That left Madley,
a village in Herefordshire about fifty miles from GCHQ headquarters, as
the country's major satellite gateway.
  After initial sorting at Bude, the intercepts are transmitted over an en-
crypted fiber-optic cable 171 miles northeast to a boxy, thirty-year-old
building at GCHQ's Oakley complex in Cheltenham, Gloucestershire.
There in X Division they are run through supercomputers, including a
Cray 3, before being transferred by cable another four miles across town
to the organization's new high-tech facility at Benhall. In 2004, most of
Oakley and the agency's original headquarters at Benhall were destroyed


                                     217

                        B O O K T H R E E : C O O P E R A T I O N

by the wrecking ball as the new Benhall center opened for business. By
then the supercomputers were also supposed to have been moved to the
new facility. The massive undertaking, at a cost of $120 million, would
have been the most expensive and delicate move in British history.
   But as the transfer was about to take place, there was great concern
that the critical flow of intelligence would be interrupted. In particular,
it would have been impossible to monitor mobile phone chatter between
suspected terrorists. Instead, it was decided to leave the machines in place
at Oakley, along with several hundred staff, and spend $616 million on a
fiber-optic cable linking the two centers. Over the following seven years,
as the banks of supercomputers become obsolete, new machines will be
installed directly at Benhall and thus guarantee continuity.
   At the new center, the reams of intercepts would undergo final analysis
by the agency's cryptolinguists, code breakers, and data miners and other
members of the staff. Based on what information was contained in the
messages and phone calls, the analysts would write up reports and for-
ward them to the NSA and the other members of the Five Eyes pact.
   Completed in 2003, GCHQ's $660 million new headquarters totaled
1.1 million square feet and covered 176 acres. It replaced more than fifty
buildings on several sites. Many of the structures were huts similar to
those that covered Bletchley Park, the secret World War II code-breaking
center where the German Enigma code was solved. Far from Bletchley's
solemn, monastery-like environment, the new GCHQ is a marvel of space-
age construction. Made with steel, aluminum, glass, granite, Cotswold
limestone, wood, and concrete, it is built in the shape of a modernistic
silver-colored doughnut. The "hole" at the center is an open-air garden
the size of London's Albert Hall. Inside the building are enough copper
computer cables to stretch all the way to Rio de Janeiro, and surrounding
the doughnut are parking lots with about twenty-nine hundred spaces.
   The radical design by the British architect Chris Johnson was also
intended to help foster interaction in a population known for security
paranoia and eyes-lowered introversion. "It's a huge change for an orga-
nization whose traditional mentality was `Shut the door behind you, and
make sure no one follows you,' " he said. "They worked in an environ-
ment with their blinds down and doors locked. Not many people knew
who their coworkers were, and there was no real sense of community or
belonging." So today, although the building contains one million square

feet of space stretched over four floors, the doughnut shape means that
each employee is never any more than a five-minute walk from any col-
league. Also included inside the doughnut is a six-hundred-seat restau-
rant, a health club, and a museum.
   Security was also a key feature in the design, with eight inches of blast
cladding fitted to all outer walls. As a further precaution, the deeper one
goes into the doughnut, the higher the clearance required. And while the
agency remains the blackest of Britain's spy agencies, it is also striving
to be the greenest. The shell of each office chair is made from thirty-six
large recycled plastic soft drink bottles; desks and table surfaces are made
from 90 percent recycled wood; and all steel products are made from 30
percent recycled metal.
  Though it was originally built to hold about four thousand people, the
number of personnel crowding into the doughnut is now about fifty-two
hundred as a result of the buildup following the attacks on 9/11 and the
London bombings in 2005. In an effort to attract new Web-savvy recruits,
GCHQ has turned to ad campaigns within online computer games such as
Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell Double Agent and Rainbow Six Vegas. And
to find talented cipher-brains, the agency joined with the British Com-
puter Society to sponsor a code-breaking competition called the National
Cipher Challenge. Conducted on the Internet and lasting three months,
the game involved cracking coded messages passed between Lord Nel-
son and naval intelligence as they tried to block a plot by Napoleon to
obtain a mysterious Chinese weapon. To add to the complexity of the
plot, the secret to the mystery lay in the encrypted two-hundred-year-old
writings by the Elizabethan spy Christopher Marlowe.
   GCHQ's biggest need, like that of the NSA, was for linguists, and in
one recruitment pitch, the agency said it was seeking candidates fluent in
Albanian, Amharic, any other African languages, Arabic, Azeri, Baluchi,
Basque, Bengali, Brahui, Bulgarian, Chechen, Chinese, Dari, Georgian,
Greek, Gujerati, Hindi, Indonesian, Japanese, Kashmiri, Kazakh, Korean,
Kurdish-Sorani, Macedonian, Malay, Mirpuri, Nepali, Papiamento, Pa-
shto, Patois/Creoles, Persian, Polish, Potohari, Punjabi, Romanian, Serbo-
Croat, Shona, Somali, Swahili, Tamil, Turkish, Ukrainian, Urdu, Uzbek,
and Vietnamese.
   By 2007, Britain's security and intelligence budget had more than
doubled to $4.2 billion from less than $2 billion before September 2001.


                                      219

                        B O O K T H R E E : C O O P E R A T I O N

At $1.6 billion, GCHQ was the most expensive part of that budget, yet it
was still overstretched. According to a report by the Parliamentary Intelli-
gence and Security Committee, a key factor was the agency's continuous
need to support MI5's domestic terrorism investigations. One of those
was Operation Overt, a huge surveillance and intelligence effort targeting
two cells of suspected Islamic militants who were believed to be plotting
an attack on transatlantic airliners.
   In light of these domestic terrorism threats, there has been a strong
effort by the British attorney general to allow intercepts from GCHQ to
be introduced in court as evidence during trial of terrorism suspects. But
the move is greatly opposed by GCHQ officials, who claim the measure
would jeopardize its intelligence collection techniques and divert sub-
stantial resources to prepare transcripts of thousands of hours of phone
conversations for court cases. "GCHQ is, not unnaturally, nervous that its
techniques might get into the public domain," said Shadow Home Secre-
tary David Davis. Agreeing with Davis was Sir Swinton Thomas, whose
odd title was Interception of Communications Commissioner. "The num-
ber of cases where intercept material would make a substantial difference
are very few indeed or possibly even nonexistent," he said. And GCHQ
officials told members of Parliament, "So far we do not believe that any-
thing proposed passes the test of doing more good than harm."
  Another problem is the long delay in developing a secure communica-
tions system to connect GCHQ with the other intelligence agencies and
their overseas offices. Known as Scope, the system was supposed to be in
place by 2004 but has now been delayed for another five years.
   Leading the charge against using intercepted data in court was Sir Da-
vid Pepper, who was named director of GCHQ in February 2003. Quiet
and balding, Pepper spends his spare time taking long walks through the
Cheltenham countryside, experimenting in the kitchen, and listening to
music. With a doctorate in theoretical physics from St. John's College,
Oxford, more than thirty years at "the Q," and a specialty in information
technology, Pepper was the perfect technospy. Even though his agency
was already outgrowing its new doughnut-shaped home, he knew it was
destined to get fatter yet as MI5, the Security Service, continued to ex-
pand its domestic counterterrorism activities. By 2007, over two hundred
domestic extremist groups, and some two thousand individuals, were be-
ing investigated by MI5. But as the GCHQ packed more and more eaves-


                                         220

                                   P A R T N E R S

droppers and analysts into the doughnut, the quality of the intelligence
went down.
  "How much we need to grow will depend more or less on how much
ministers decide to grow the Security Service," said Pepper, who planned
to retire in July 2008, after five years as head of GCHQ. "So our CT
[counterterrorism] capability will need to keep pace so we can support
the number of operations there that they are running . . . By the end of
the year we had found that we were managing to support most of Security
Service's highest-priority operations, but we were not achieving the qual-
ity of support that we and they had agreed we should aim for . . . essen-
tially because we were spreading ourselves too thin . . . We do not have
enough CT resources."
   The biggest problem, according to Pepper, was the ever-expanding In-
ternet and especially the increasing use of the Internet for phone calls.
These VoIP calls frustrate the eavesdroppers at GCHQ because they by-
pass the traditional telecom hubs and gateways, such as Bude, that are
piped to the agency. "The Internet uses a very different approach to com-
munications," said Pepper, "in that, rather than having any sense of fixed
lines like that, there is a big network with a number of nodes, but for
any individual communicating, their communications are broken up into
shorter packets. So whether you are sending an e-mail or any other form
of Internet communication, anything you send is broken up into packets.
These packets are then routed around the network and may go in any one
of a number of different routes because the network is designed to be
resilient . . . This [represents] the biggest change in telecoms technology
since the invention of the telephone. It is a complete revolution."
   In order to bring some relief to GCHQ, the Intelligence and Security
Committee, which oversees the spy agencies, developed a Sigint modern-
ization program. This included a twentyfold increase in the agency's abil-
ity to access, process, and store Internet and telephone data. It also led
to "the automation of certain aspects of the analysis of communications,
allowing improved identification of networks--a task that previously had
to be performed manually. As a result, analysts now have more time to
interpret the data and establish its significance."
   The number of people in Britain whose communications were targeted
had exploded in recent years. According to the 2007 report by the In-
terception of Communications Commissioner, the watchdog office that


                                       221

                        B O O K T H R E E : C O O P E R A T I O N

oversees eavesdropping by the intelligence community, over 439,000 re-
quests were made to monitor people's telephone calls, e-mails, and letters
by secret agencies and police departments in just over a year. The report
also revealed that nearly four thousand errors were reported in a fifteen-
month period. The author of the report, Sir Swinton Thomas, described
the figures as "unacceptably high." Human rights groups labeled the rev-
elations as signs of a "creeping contempt for our personal privacy."




   Stretched along the curving Middle East seabed, the FLAG Falcon
cable comes ashore in a number of countries with high intelligence value.
Connecting Egypt to Mumbai, India, it traverses Oman, Bahrain, Kuwait,
Qatar, and others. Of most interest to the NSA, however, are Iran, Iraq,
Sudan, and Yemen, all of which have either joined or are eager to soon
do so. The agency had long targeted Iran's nine Intelsat and four Inmarsat
earth stations, and its microwave links to Turkey, Pakistan, and Afghani-
stan, but the thought of much of that traffic being transferred to a subsea
cable has many at Fort Meade nervous.
   Containing 120,000 voice and data circuits, the $1.2 billion cable is
owned by FLAG (Fiber-optic Link Around the Globe), the world's larg-
est private undersea cable system, with a vast network spanning forty
thousand miles. Upon the completion of its newest cable, FLAG NGN,
the company will soon have the capacity to carry a massive 2.5 billion
simultaneous voice calls and 300 million simultaneous webchats in sixty
countries on four continents. It is the Gulf region's most powerful cable,
operating at a terabit per second, and its ring shape also provides redun-
dancy, known as a self-healing capability.
   For the NSA, as the Middle East seabed becomes layered with cables,
it must begin establishing secret relationships with countries outside its
exclusive Five Eyes club, something that is already happening, according
to Keith Coulter, who, from 2001 until 2005, was director of the Cana-
dian member of the group. According to Coulter, the Five Eyes "form
the tightest and most historical partnership that we have had. It is strong."
But, he noted, times are changing and his agency and the other members
must also begin forming other cooperative arrangements. "The group,"
he said, "has been longstanding and successful but the world is evolving


                                         222

                                   P A R T N E R S

and so other partnerships are necessary, on our part and our allies' part. I
belong to a European group that includes a number of countries, among
which there is some sharing because there is much interest in terrorism."
   Probably the best place within the entire region to install a listening
post is the Indian city of Mumbai. It represents the kind of location where
the NSA would seek to establish a secret presence; it is also an example
of how many people may now be tapping into private phone calls and
e-mail worldwide. From a listening post in Mumbai, eavesdroppers could
listen to conversations between Europe and Asia, for example.
   Mumbai contains the central switch for virtually all the cables in the
Middle East and much of Asia, including FLAG, FLAG Falcon, SEA-
ME-WE 3, and SEA-ME-WE 4. SEA-ME-WE 3 alone is the longest
system in the world at over twenty-four thousand miles--the distance
around the earth. It has thirty-nine landing points in thirty-three countries
on four continents, from Western Europe (including Germany, England,
and France) to the Far East (including China, Japan, and Singapore) and
Australia. Some of the cables connecting in Mumbai also have links to
Iran, Pakistan, and other countries of great interest to the NSA.
   The Mumbai switch is owned by VSNL, part of the Indian government.
A few years ago the Indian NSA, Research and Analysis Wing (RAW),
proposed tapping into it, according to Major General V. K. Singh, a for-
mer top official for RAW. "Sometime in 2000­2001," Singh said, "some-
one in RAW proposed that monitoring equipment should be installed at
the VSNL gateway in Mumbai. When I joined RAW in November 2000,
the project was still being discussed." VSNL, he added, "agreed to pro-
vide the facilities for installation of the interception equipment, but ex-
pressed misgivings about the presence of RAW personnel and equipment
in its premises, which were frequently visited by foreign members of the
consortium [that owned the cables]."
   To alleviate the company's concern, RAW suggested that the company
buy and install the equipment themselves and then apply for reimburse-
ment from the intelligence agency. But while the company found the
arrangement agreeable, Singh himself was troubled. "I had felt uneasy
about the project right from the beginning," he said. "It would have been
okay if we were going to intercept traffic going from or coming to India.
One could always justify this on the ground that we wanted to monitor
traffic related to terrorism . . . But the SMW 3 [Southeast Asia­Middle


                                       223

                         B O O K T H R E E : C O O P E R A T I O N

East­Western Europe cable] was also carrying traffic that had nothing to
do with India. What right did we have to monitor a call between a person
in Germany who was talking to someone in Japan? . . . I expressed my
misgivings several times . . . What we were planning to do was clearly
another form of illegal interception. In fact, it was worse because we
would not only be violating our own but also international laws. I was
surprised when I found that other people in RAW not only disagreed but
scoffed at my ideas."
   General Singh was relieved when VSNL became privatized and was
sold to the very large Indian company the Tata Group, thinking that the
new company would not want to get involved in illegally spying on its
customers. "But apparently this did not happen," he said. Agreements
between the company and the government were signed. Singh left RAW
in 2004, and he does not know if it is continuing. "But the fact that it
was planned and approved raises many questions," he said. "Intelligence
agencies need to be reminded, occasionally, that they are working not for
themselves but the country and its citizens, who must never be humiliated
by their actions."
   More recently, the Indian government has become alarmed at the re-
alization that BlackBerry users are able to evade its digital dragnet when
sending e-mail. As a result, the government gave the four domestic mo-
bile operators offering the service a deadline to detail precisely how they
route their users' messages or have the system terminated. It is a preview
of what may eventually happen in other democracies, including the U.S.,
as eavesdropping becomes all encompassing.
   A key problem for New Delhi officials is the fact that BlackBerry's
encrypted e-mail passes through servers all based outside the country.
The system is licensed to India's mobile operators by Research in Motion
(RIM), a Canadian company so confident in the security of its encryp-
tion that it considers it virtually unbreakable. "Rumours speculating that
[e-mail] can be intercepted and read by the National Security Agency in
the U.S.," RIM has claimed, "or other `spy' organisations are based on
false and misleading information." In an extraordinary move, in an effort
to resolve the impasse and prevent the mobile e-mail service from being
shut down, Canada's electronic spies have agreed to help India's RAW
intercept the BlackBerry messages.
  Whether the NSA currently has its own equipment at the Mumbai

landing station is unknown, but among the tools the Bush administration
uses to get governments to cooperate in its eavesdropping operations are
cash, equipment, and political pressure. The administration has recently
used all three with Mexico, a country with an atrocious record of police
corruption, torture, and human rights abuses. The State Department's Hu-
man Rights Report for 2006 said Mexico's "deeply entrenched culture of
impunity and corruption persisted, particularly at the state and local level.
The following human rights problems were reported: unlawful killings by
security forces; kidnappings, including by police; torture; poor and over-
crowded prison conditions; arbitrary arrests and detention; corruption,
inefficiency, and lack of transparency in the judicial system; statements
coerced through torture permitted as evidence in trials; criminal intimi-
dation of journalists, leading to self-censorship; corruption at all levels
of government; domestic violence against women often perpetrated with
impunity; criminal violence, including killings against women; traffick-
ing in persons, sometimes allegedly with official involvement; social and
economic discrimination against indigenous people; and child labor."
   There is also a long tradition of illegal eavesdropping in Mexico, espe-
cially on opposition political leaders. One case was accidentally discov-
ered in 1998 in Campeche, a city on the Yucatán Peninsula surrounded by
ancient Spanish walls and fortifications used centuries ago to protect the
population from pirates and buccaneers. One night after sunset, Layda
Sansores Sanroman rapped on the door of an old concrete house at the
center of the city. When a janitor opened it, she walked into a government
espionage center. Lining the back room walls were racks of electronic
eavesdropping equipment. Another room was crammed with seven years'
worth of transcripts from telephone taps--thousands of pages of private
conversations from politicians, journalists, and everyday citizens.
  "I was furious to discover my life on papers, documents, recordings
and computer files," said Sansores, a fifty-two-year-old senator from an
opposition political party who had been tipped off by an anonymous note.
"Seven years of my life were there, tracked in detail." She and her aides
later discovered that the equipment had been purchased by the govern-
ment for $1.2 million from Israel.
   More than a dozen other examples of systematic government eaves-
dropping around the country were also discovered about the same time--
from hidden cameras and microphones uncovered in the offices of the


                                     225

                        B O O K T H R E E : C O O P E R A T I O N

Mexico City government to interceptions of telephone calls by a state
governor. "The discoveries--and the willingness of the targets to go pub-
lic with evidence--confirmed many Mexicans' long-held suspicion that
their government has acted as an omnipresent Big Brother spying on its
citizenry, its perceived enemies and, frequently, on some of its own agen-
cies and officials," said one news report at the time.
  "Everything I say and do, I assume that I am being spied on," said Gua-
najuato state governor Vicente Fox, who would later be elected president,
and whose phones were also tapped. Mariclaire Acosta, the president
of the Mexican Commission for the Defense and Promotion of Human
Rights, expressed a view felt by many. "It is a horrible, filthy method of
political control," she said. "It's a fundamental violation of the right to
privacy." She added that she was also a regular target of wiretaps. "The
life of everybody in town is there."
   Aware of Mexico's abysmal record in both human rights and in elec-
tronic surveillance, in 2006 the Bush administration entered into a quiet
agreement with the Mexican government to fund and build an enormous
$3 million telephone and Internet eavesdropping center that would reach
into every town and village in the country. According to a State Depart-
ment document used to solicit vendors for the system, the United States
would provide Mexico "with the capability to intercept, analyze, and use
intercepted information from all types of communications systems oper-
ating in Mexico." The document continued:


   The U.S. Government intends to procure a communications in-
   tercept system that enables the timely receipt, processing, analy-
   sis, and storage of intercepted communications from the national
   telephonic and other communications service providers in Mexico.
   The proposed system must comply with the following AFI [Agen-
   cia Federal de Investigaciones, Mexico's Federal Investigative
   Agency] stated requirements for interception of target calls and ses-
   sions from (1) TELMEX PSTN network, through analog lines, (2)
   TELCEL TDMA and GSM network, (3) NEXTEL iDEIM/GSM
   network, (4) TELEFONICA network, (5) UNEFON network, (6)
   IUSACELL CDMA network and TDMA network, (7) Existing
   CISCO VoIP network at customer's premises, (8) packet data from
   the Mexico PRODIGY ISP network. Additionally the client desires


                                         226

                                  P A R T N E R S

   the establishment of a central monitoring center with the capabilities
   of (1) real-time and off-line playback, (2) fax decoding, (3) packet
   data decoding, (4) storage of all calls for at least 25,000 hours, (5)
   storage of all session related information, (6) 30 monitoring sta-
   tions and 30 printers, (7) cellular location and tracking. Capabilities
   must include TDMA, GSM, CDMA, iDEN, AMPS, PCS, landline,
   FAX, Email, chat, Internet, SMS and VoIP. The communications
   intercept system must include all necessary hardware, software and
   equipment required to provide a complete solution. Proposals must
   include pricing for the complete system, installation of the system,
   training in Spanish on use of the system and technical support.


   The system the Bush administration wanted for Mexico was similar
to its warrantless eavesdropping operation in the U.S. "The target phone
database should be able to accommodate a maximum of 8,000,000 ses-
sions," it added, "programmable by telephone service provider and moni-
toring center operators." The surveillance center would also have "the
ability to generate a data bank for voices for the analysis of comparison,
recognition and identification." This would give the center the capability
to scan millions of telephone calls using voice prints of their targets. An-
other innovation was the ability to bring under surveillance ever widening
circles of people--not just the target, but whoever called the target and
then whoever called that person, and so on. "The ability," said the pro-
posal, "to analyze calls (call crossovers) and the automatic generation of
links between them." The system was also required to reach every phone
in the country. "The Contractor shall be responsible," said the document,
"for integrating into the telephone intercept system the required plans and
maps of the entire Mexican Republic."
   The deal underscores the close relationship between the country's con-
servative president, Felipe Calderon, and George W. Bush. In addition to
the installation of the Bush administration's countrywide bugging sys-
tem, Calderon was also attempting to amend the Mexican Constitution
to allow the government to eavesdrop without a judge's approval under
various conditions. While he argued that he needed the system and the
freedom from court scrutiny in order to fight drugs and organized crime,
many in Mexico were not buying it. Among them was Renato Sales, a
former deputy prosecutor for Mexico City, who compared Calderon's


                                      227

                        B O O K T H R E E : C O O P E R A T I O N

plan to the Bush administration's warrantless eavesdropping program.
"Suddenly anyone suspected of organized crime is presumed guilty and
treated as someone without any constitutional rights," he said. Now a law
professor at the Autonomous Technological Institute of Mexico, Sales
added, "And who will determine who is an organized crime suspect? The
state will."
   Both sides have tried to avoid drawing attention to the agreement,
however, because of the potential hostile reaction by the Mexican public
to the possibility that all their phone calls and e-mail might be analyzed
and stored not only by their own government but also by intelligence
agents in Washington.
   For the Bush administration and the NSA, there may be some sig-
nificant strings attached to the offer to wire Mexico border to border and
coast to coast with a free $3 million eavesdropping system. Most impor-
tant, the U.S. will get full access to the data, possibly in a way similar to
the setup with AT&T in San Francisco. It is the type of deal NSA may
be working out with countries around the world as part of an Echelon
II­style operation. A key problem with such a worldwide system is that
it would supply countries with potentially even worse human rights and
privacy records than Mexico with a critical means of internal repression.
   The strings attached are contained in the part of the proposal labeled
"Requirements." One of these items is a requirement "to disseminate
timely and accurate, actionable information to each country's respective
federal, state, local, private, and international partners." Since the U.S.
certainly qualifies as an "international partner," it means Mexico is obli-
gated to disseminate its data to a U.S. agency. But what is perhaps even
more troublesome is the requirement to share its data with "private" part-
ners--in other words private surveillance companies within the U.S.
   This type of arrangement with Mexico and other countries may in fact
be among the most secret parts of the Bush administration's entire war-
rantless eavesdropping program. That is because it completely bypasses
the requirement for probable cause that one of the parties is connected
to al-Qaeda. The intercepted data is gathered by Mexicans in Mexico--
much of it involving calls to and from Americans across the border--and
passed in bulk to the U.S., possibly to the NSA or FBI or Drug Enforce-
ment Administration. Rather than al-Qaeda, it might involve drugs. Ac-
cording to a number of legal scholars, it may even be possible to introduce


                                         228

                                 P A R T N E R S

this type of information in U.S. courts. The protections offered by the
Fourth Amendment, they say, do not apply outside the United States, es-
pecially when the surveillance is conducted by another country.
   An indication of this can be seen in the evasive answers to questions
put to the NSA general counsel Robert Deitz in 2006 by Congressman
Robert C. Scott, a Virginia Democrat, during a congressional hearing.
Scott attempted to pin Deitz down on whether there was a second, more
secret element to the warrantless eavesdropping operation. "Is there an-
other program?" he asked. "I mean you are using twenty questions. We
are trying to get around to, if I can ask the right question, to target the
right answer. Are you wiretapping people without an individual assess-
ment of probable cause that they are a member of al-Qaeda or without a
warrant?" Deitz responded, "I can't answer that." Nor did he volunteer to
provide an answer in closed session.
   But coming to his rescue was Steven G. Bradbury, the Justice De-
partment point man on the warrantless surveillance program, who chose
his words very carefully. "Well, if I might just jump in, Congressman. I
think the president has made it clear that there is no other program that
involves domestic electronic surveillance of domestic communications,
and so the program that the President has described is the only program
along those lines" [emphasis added]. By deliberately adding that caveat,
"domestic" electronic surveillance, Bradbury appeared to be leaving open
the possibility of foreign electronic surveillance of U.S. domestic com-
munications.
   Using non­U.S. citizens in a foreign country to evade the law and
eavesdrop on Americans is not a new idea. In the 1970s, the Bureau of
Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs (BNDD)--the predecessor of the Drug
Enforcement Administration--was unable to obtain a judicial warrant to
eavesdrop on a group of Americans within the U.S. As a result, they se-
cretly turned to the NSA and asked them to conduct the illegal eavesdrop-
ping on their behalf. The NSA agreed, but the agency was nervous about
giving the watch list containing the U.S. names to its intercept operators
at the U.S. listening post (probably Sugar Grove, West Virginia). Because
they were mostly military, they were worried about frequent turnover of
personnel and the risk of the operation leaking out. Thus they asked the
CIA to give help in conducting the eavesdropping with the watch list,
which they agreed to do.


                                     229

                        B O O K T H R E E : C O O P E R A T I O N

   However, when the cooperation was discovered by the CIA's general
counsel, Larry Houston, it was abruptly called to a halt. In Houston's
opinion the activity possibly violated Section 605 of the Communica-
tions Act of 1934, prohibiting the unauthorized disclosure of private
communications. He concluded, too, that since the intercepted messages
were eventually given by the NSA to BNDD, the activity was for law en-
forcement purposes, which was outside the CIA's charter. As a result of
Houston's memorandum, the CIA suspended any further collection.
   But according to the NSA's deputy director at the time, Louis Tordella,
the major reason for the CIA pullout was that the phone calls were be-
ing intercepted from American soil. "I was told that if they could move a
group of Cubans up to Canada," Tordella said, "it would be quite all right,
but they would not do it in the United States." Rebuffed by the CIA, the
NSA continued the operation itself. A few years later it was among the
many illegal programs uncovered by the Church Committee that led to
FISA. Now the idea may have returned. If so, countries like Mexico and
Britain could target American communications with their own nationals,
on their own territory, and pass the information to the NSA.
   Canada, however, despite Tordella's suggestion, seems an unlikely
candidate to assist the NSA in spying on Americans, despite sharing our
northern border. Since the very beginning, Canada's highly secret Com-
munications Security Establishment (CSE) has been a key member of the
Five Eyes partnership. During the Cold War, the organization played a
large role in monitoring Soviet submarine and shipping activities in the
Arctic. Then in August 2001 Keith Coulter became director and moved
into his office in the Edward Drake Building, a modern six-story rein-
forced concrete and steel structure in the shape of a Y. Set in a modern,
parklike landscape at the crest of a hill on Ottawa's Bronson Avenue, it
was once the home of the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation. Today it
pulls signals in rather than sending them out.
   A onetime fighter pilot with the Snowbirds, the Canadian Forces Air
Demonstration Team, and later a planner with the Treasury Board, Coul-
ter was in office for just five weeks before the attacks of 9/11. Almost
overnight, he was forced to put his agency into overdrive, to quickly move
it into the twenty-first century. "Throughout the 1990s as CSE moved
further away from its Cold War focus, the pace of change in the telecom-
munications world moved from evolutionary to truly revolutionary," he


                                         230

                                 P A R T N E R S

said. "The routing of messages became unpredictable. Anything could be
anywhere in this new communications landscape." Coulter added, "Fur-
ther, in the new environment, communications were moving in complex
bundles that had to be mapped and analyzed before acquisition was even
possible."
   Another problem was legal--the CSE was prohibited from eavesdrop-
ping on not only domestic communications but also international, where
one end of a conversation touched Canada. The law, Coulter said, "af-
fected CSE in two ways. First, it prevented CSE from intercepting com-
munications that an intelligence target abroad sent to or received from
Canada. For example, CSE could not provide intelligence on a known
terrorist group abroad if it was communicating with a member or accom-
plice in Canada. Second, this provision prevented CSE from intercepting
any communications that might contain private communications. The dif-
ficulty here was that, in this new technological environment where any-
thing could be anywhere in virtually endless communications haystacks
and electronic highways, it was impossible for CSE to prove, before it
acquired a communication, that both ends of the communication would
be foreign. The result was that as technologies continued to evolve, CSE
was increasingly unable to access valuable intelligence sources. By the
time of the events of 9/11, all of CSE's international partners--the U.S.,
Britain, Australia, and New Zealand--had already found ways to deal
with this issue. CSE was being left behind."
   To catch up, Coulter was able to obtain changes in Canada's Anti-Ter-
rorism Act that allowed CSE to begin targeting foreigners and foreign
organizations abroad. "The act," he said, "allowed CSE to get back into
the game . . . The authority that was given to us by Parliament allows us
to get at that very rare but important call between, say, a terrorist group
and a Canadian. It may be of international as well as national importance
because of relationships."
   But unlike the NSA's policy of warrantless targeting of Americans,
CSE's ear is still welded to its base pointed outward. According to Coul-
ter, his organization is forbidden from targeting Canadians either at home
or abroad. "CSE is prohibited from directing its activities against Ca-
nadians or anyone else located within the twelve-mile limit that defines
Canadian territory," he said. "CSE is also prohibited from directing its
activities at Canadians abroad, defined in the act as Canadians or perma-


                                     231

                        B O O K T H R E E : C O O P E R A T I O N

nent residents." In addition, a National Defense Headquarters instruction
also forbids domestic eavesdropping.
   Coulter indicates that CSE, once seen as little more than the NSA's Ca-
nadian stepchild, has become more independent. He says the CSE even
refuses to share with the NSA any communications touching Canadian
territory, such as the international fiber-optic cables entering and leaving
Pennant Point, near Halifax, Nova Scotia, or the satellite gateways at Pen-
nant Point, Laurentides in Quebec, and Lake Cowichan in British Colum-
bia. "We do not share with the United States anything that would involve
one-end Canadian. I want to make it very clear, that is not something
we do," he said. "The kind of thing we collect, that very small volume
of information that we have that has an end in Canada, is shared within
Canada and not within our partnership community." In fact, in 2003, dur-
ing the United Nations Security Council debate over whether to invade
Iraq, the NSA asked all Five Eyes countries to target the communications
between diplomats on the Council. Canada, which had opposed the inva-
sion, was the only member to refuse.
   Today, CSE's budget has skyrocketed from the years before the 9/11
attacks, going from $140 million in 2000 to more than $200 million by
2007. It also increased its personnel by 80 percent to about 1,700.
   To house them, the agency is constructing a new $62 million (Canadian
dollars), 65,000-square-foot headquarters building in Ottawa. During the
Cold War, one of the CSE's most important listening posts was in the far
north at Alert, on the northeastern tip of Ellesmere Island in the Nuna-
vut territory. The northernmost permanently inhabited settlement in the
world--only about 450 miles from the North Pole--Alert was the perfect
place to eavesdrop on the northernmost reaches of the Soviet Union be-
cause it was closer to Moscow than to Ottawa. There were about 215 in-
tercept operators and support personnel posted there during the station's
heyday. But the demise of the Soviet Union meant the end of Alert.
   To eavesdrop on the Pacific, a station was established at Masset, at the
top end of Graham Island off British Columbia. And the Atlantic region
was monitored by a station at Gander in eastern Newfoundland. But in
the late 1990s, both stations were, like Alert, largely shut down. They
focused on high-frequency communications and the world had shifted
to satellites and fiber-optic cables. Thus, what is left of the three stations
is now remotely controlled by the CSE's principal listening post at CFS


                                         232

                                  P A R T N E R S

Leitrim, located at 3545 Leitrim Road in Gloucester, just south of Ottawa.
Originally opened in 1941, the station now has 450 military personnel
and twenty-eight civilian employees and targets satellite communications
with four radome-covered dishes behind the main building.
   The current chief of CSE is sixty-six-year-old John L. Adams, who
replaced Keith Coulter in July 2005. He dislikes the Orwellian image
some people have of his agency. "I get very concerned about this `Big
Brother is watching me.' Nothing could be further from the truth," he
says. The major problem, according to Adams, is volume. Even "with
all of your fancy electronic filters," he says, "Big Brother would just be
overwhelmed." Adams then gives the numbers. "There are one billion In-
ternet users online right now," he says. "Over fifty billion e-mails are sent
every day. The sheer volume, the variety, the velocity, the complexity of
communications today would make this absurdly impossible. Especially
for an organization of our small size."
   Like Coulter, Adams also says that there are no agreements between
the NSA and CSE to spy on each other's citizens. "There are all sorts of
myths about CSE," he says. "One is that we ask our partner organizations
in the Five Eyes community to target Canadian communications for us, or
that we target their citizens for them. I can tell you that we do not."
   An odd choice for chief, Adams had spent his career in the Canadian
army largely as a bureaucrat and generalist. The five years prior to taking
over the electronic spy agency he spent as a senior official in the fisheries
and ocean department of the Coast Guard. In fact, prior to his appoint-
ment he didn't even know what the organization did. "It's very much a
need-to-know business, and I didn't need to know, so I didn't know."
   For those countries beyond the Five Eyes, without an NSA or a CSE
or a GCHQ, there are a few companies that will build them the next best
thing.

J   ust across busy Interstate 395 from the Pentagon, Crystal City is a
    beehive of overweight contractors, military personnel in ill-fitting ci-
vilian clothes, and spooks behind Ray-Ban aviation-style sunglasses. In
restaurants, walking down sidewalks, or filling up at gas stations, nearly
everyone has a stack of playing-card-size badges hanging on black straps
around their necks. Prestige is measured not in the make of their jeans, or
the cut of their suits, but by the color and number of their badges, worn
like battle ribbons from some secret war.
   Once a desolate land of junkyards, drive-in movie theaters, used-car
lots, and towing companies, crisscrossed by rusted railroad tracks, this
area was transformed by the developer Robert H. Smith in the 1960s.
Hoping to give his new community a fresh image, he hung an elaborate
crystal chandelier in the lobby of the first building and named it Crystal
House. Thereafter, every other building took on the Crystal theme--Crys-
tal Gateway, Crystal Towers--until the entire area became Crystal City.
Like the nature of the work that goes on there, much of the city is hidden
from view.
   On one level, Crystal City is a modern vertical village of sixty thou-
sand daytime workers cocooned in odd-shaped dominos of glass, brick,
and cement. Bland office towers connect to bland hotels that connect to
bland no-name government high-rises. But below the buildings, streets,
and sidewalks is a hidden, underground city of chophouses and flower-
decorated boutiques, sushi dens and shoe repair shops. It is a place where


                                    234

                               W I R E T A P P E R S

people just back from the Green Zone bump into one another and others
on their way to Afghanistan pick up electric transformers and have their
body armor tailored.
   Crystal City was thus an ideal venue for the Wiretappers' Ball. Known
formally as the Intelligence Support System World Conference, it is a
once-a-year secretive conclave of engineers and scientists in search of the
ultimate bug. It is the place to come to discuss the latest developments
in mass surveillance, how to listen in on entire continents at the least
cost, and the best ways to tap into--or shut down--the newest Internet
phone system. Picking up shiny brochures at booths and listening to the
lectures are an assortment of doctoral-level computer scientists; electrical
engineers with decades in the telecom business; government agents from
superpowers and mini-states, democracies and dictatorships; and wealthy
venture capitalists and start-up owners trying to impress them. The one
group conspicuously absent is anyone even remotely connected to the
media--a policy enforced by linebackers with earplugs and bulges under
their blue blazers.
   In 2006, the three-day Wiretappers' Ball was held in Crystal City's
Hilton in late May. A sense of the atmosphere can be gleaned from the
highly confidential program of lectures. On Monday, May 22, at 4:00, one
could attend a talk on "Combining Data and Voice over Broadband into a
Unified Interception Solution" given by an employee of Verint Systems.
On Tuesday at 1:30, another Verint employee addressed "Broadening the
Scope of Interception: Data Retention." A half hour later an employee
of Agilent Technologies spoke about "Comprehensive Data Extraction
for Flexible and Accurate Intelligence." Then at 2:45, still another Verint
worker discussed "Comprehensive Solutions for Packet Data Collection:
DEEPVIEW." "Verint's DEEPVIEW," said the description of the talk, "is
a packet data collection system with the comprehensive functionality to
penetrate deep into communications and turn raw, intercepted data into
actionable intelligence and compelling evidence."
  And on Wednesday, at 10:15, an employee of NICE Systems ad-
dressed the topic of "Unifying Telephony, VoIP and IP Interception for a
Complete Overview of Your Target's Interactions." For those still awake,
another Verint worker then took on the topic of "Challenges of Imple-
menting Passive Interception for IMS [Instant Message Systems]." Next,
the company NSC discussed locating keywords in masses of informa-


                                       235

                         B O O K T H R E E : C O O P E R A T I O N

tion in a lecture titled "NSC Spotter." "NSC's Key-Word Spotting (KWS)
engine," said a company employee, "is designed for locating predefined
words in audio conversations in real-time and off-line calls. The engine is
used for speech analytics and call surveillance."
   This hidden-from-view bugging industry got its start as a result of the
passage of CALEA in 1994. The law mandated the telecom companies
to configure their networks to supply the government with intercepts au-
thorized by a court-issued warrant. But following the attacks on 9/11 and
President Bush's secret order to begin massive warrantless eavesdrop-
ping, the industry began a period of explosive growth. Not only were
sales booming, so was the competition to build bigger and better "mass
surveillance systems" that incorporated both nationwide interception ca-
pabilities and advanced data-mining techniques. Once built, the systems
were sold to whoever would buy them, including some of the most re-
pressive and authoritarian governments on the planet.
   Closer to home, America's two major telecom companies, AT&T and
Verizon, have outsourced the bugging of their entire networks--carry-
ing billions of American communications every day--to two mysterious
companies with very troubling foreign connections. In AT&T's secret
room in San Francisco, a mirror image of all data entering the building
is filtered through surveillance equipment supplied and maintained by
Narus. Verizon, which controls most of the rest of the country's domestic
and international communications networks, chose a different company.
According to knowledgeable sources, that company is Verint.
   According to these sources, in 2006 Verizon constructed its "secret
room" on the second floor of a nondescript two-story building at 14503
Luthe Road in Houston, Texas. Once Verizon receives watch-listed names
from the NSA, it then reroutes their Internet communications into that
room, which is packed with secret Verint machines and software. After
passing through the Verint hardware, the messages are then transmitted in
real time to a central government surveillance hub in Sterling, Virginia.
   Run by the FBI, the hub is a newly built annex for the bureau's En-
gineering Research Facility (ERF), located on the grounds of the FBI
Academy in Quantico, Virginia. Among the technologies developed by
ERF is Carnivore, later given the more benign-sounding name DCS-1000,
which is a sophisticated Internet "packet sniffer." While Verint and Narus
sift through traffic at key Internet gateways around the country, Carni-


                                          236

                               W I R E T A P P E R S

vore, or one of its successors, is used when the target has been narrowed
down to a smaller, individual ISP. Thus, if Verint detects that a target is
a subscriber to a small California-based Internet provider, the FBI can
install its DCS-1000 at the company's office to record his activity. The
device can also transmit the data back to the FBI in real time. An en-
crypted T1 cable connects the ERF Annex in Sterling directly to the NSA
at Fort Meade.
    Follow-on projects to the DCS-1000 include the DCS-5000, which is
designed for FISA surveillance; the DCS-3000 for pen register (a device
used to record all numbers dialed from a tapped phone) and trap-and-trace
taps; and the DCS-6000, nicknamed Digital Storm, which intercepts the
contents of phone calls and text messages. Once the information is sent
back to the ERF, it is indexed and prioritized by the bureau's Electronic
Surveillance (ELSUR) Data Management System. Other eavesdropping
tools in the FBI's toolbox include a collection of intrusive spyware such
as CIPAV, which stands for Computer and Internet Protocol Address Ver-
ifier. The program can be remotely implanted into a target computer to
secretly send back to intelligence agents key details about the machine,
including its IP address, operating system type, Internet browser, and a
list of active programs. The CIPAV then transforms itself into a cyber pen
register, logging the address information of every computer with which
it comes into contact and then transmitting the details back to the ERF
Annex in Sterling.
   Another remotely installed and operated program, Magic Lantern, has
the capability of recording and transmitting back in real time the target's
every keystroke. Both spyware programs have likely been used on for-
eign targets, but only CIPAV appears to have been used domestically thus
far. It was implanted in a target's MySpace account, and when he opened
it, it launched in his system.
   While Verizon's data network is centrally tapped at Luthe Road in
Houston, it appears that the voice network is monitored from the com-
pany's sprawling facility on Hidden Ridge Avenue in Irving, Texas, near
Dallas. It is there that the company's Global Security Operations Center
keeps tabs on the entire Verizon system, looking for fraud. According to
a sworn affidavit by Babak Pasdar, a computer security expert who has
worked as a contractor for a number of major telecoms, he discovered
a mysterious DS-3 line at the heart of one company's system--a link


                                       237

                        B O O K T H R E E : C O O P E R A T I O N

labeled "Quantico Circuit." His description of the company and the link
seems to match that of Verizon as outlined in a lawsuit against the com-
pany. "The circuit was tied to the organization's core network," Pasdar
said. "It had access to the billing system, text messaging, fraud detec-
tion, website, and pretty much all the systems in the data center without
apparent restrictions." He added, "Everyone was uncomfortable talking
about it."
  While such tools as DCS-1000 and CIPAV are used on a small number
of select targets, Verint and Narus are superintrusive--conducting mass
surveillance on both international and domestic communications 24/7.
What is especially troubling, but little known, is that both companies have
extensive ties to a foreign country, Israel, as well as links to that country's
intelligence service--a service with a long history of aggressive spying
against the U.S. Equally troubling, the founder and former chairman of
one of the companies is now a fugitive, wanted by the FBI on nearly three
dozen charges of fraud, theft, lying, bribery, money laundering, and other
crimes. Although there has long been Congressional oversight of the tele-
com industry, there is virtually no oversight of the companies hired to do
the bugging.
  Verint was founded by a former Israeli intelligence officer, Jacob Alex-
ander, who often goes by the nickname "Kobi." His father, Zvi Alexander,
was a wealthy Israeli oil baron and an international wheeler-dealer who
ended up running the country's state-owned oil company. To win drilling
franchises, he would make political payments to African cabinet minis-
ters, often in partnership with the U.S. tax cheat Marc Rich, who became
a fugitive and was given sanctuary in Israel. In his autobiography, the
senior Alexander ridiculed America for criminalizing the bribery of for-
eign officials. The U.S., he wrote, is "very sanctimonious" and "refuses
to accept the facts of life in the developing world."
   Like his father, Kobi was also interested in making millions. After
earning a degree in economics from the Hebrew University of Jerusalem
in 1977 and spending several years in Israeli intelligence, he moved to
New York, where he worked as an investment banker at Shearson Loeb
Rhoades (now Smith Barney) while attending New York University at
night for his MBA in finance.
   Soon after completing his degree in 1980, Alexander returned to Israel
and formed a voice- and fax-messaging company with two other Israelis,


                                         238

                               W I R E T A P P E R S

Boaz Misholi and his brother-in-law, Yechiam Yimini. Called Efrat, the
start-up was financed in part with subsidies from the Israeli government.
Four years later, the three returned to New York and opened a company
called Comverse, which was also incorporated in Israel. Its name a blend
of "communications" and "versatility," Comverse became heavily in-
volved in wireless technology, voice-mail software, and other areas of
the telecom sector.
  While deal making was taking place in the U.S., the secretive research
and development was done in Comverse Technology's Israeli headquar-
ters. Surrounded by sushi bars, gourmet coffee places, and a kosher Mc-
Donald's, the research center and other facilities are located in a cluster
of seven buildings on Habarzel Street in Tel Aviv's high-tech Ramat Ha-
hayal industrial park. In Israel, Alexander had become widely celebrated
for his telecom fortune. "Kobi was an Israeli hero, one of our real high-
tech pioneers," said Ron Tira, a Tel Aviv­based mutual fund manager
with investments in Comverse.
   One of the new products being developed in Tel Aviv was a digital
surveillance device called AudioDisk that could monitor and record hun-
dreds of telephone and fax machine lines simultaneously. The machine
made the old reel-to-reel tape recorders obsolete: the data could be stored
in "jukeboxes" and be available to the user instantly. The use of digital
technology also meant that a key word or phrase could be located im-
mediately, rather than by rewinding the tape to the right spot. The system
was a major hit with intelligence agencies and police units in the U.S.
and around the world, and ended up bringing in half of the company's
revenues in 1993. Eventually, the business was spun off into a separate
subsidiary called Comverse Infosys.
  The security surge that followed the attacks on 9/11 sent the value
of the company skyrocketing. Five months after the attacks, Alexander
renamed the subsidiary Verint Systems, Inc. (short for Verified Intelli-
gence), took over as chairman, and made plans to take it public. Named
president and CEO was Dan Bodner, a former Israeli army engineer with
degrees from the Technion and Tel Aviv University, and nearly fifteen
years of experience at Comverse.
   Soon, Verint was selling its "actionable intelligence solutions" to
"more than 5,000 organizations in over 100 countries" around the world,
according to the company, including the most repressive. For Kobi Al-

exander the war on terror was a boom time. He purchased a number of
expensive condominiums in a luxury high-rise on New York's West 57th
Street, bought a 25 percent stake in Tel Aviv's basketball team, enter-
tained clients at Knicks games at Madison Square Garden, and bragged
he could borrow oodles of money with a few business ideas scribbled on
a napkin. No matter how much he had, Alexander's deep pockets could
always hold more--and he decided the U.S. was the place to get it.
   As his Israeli engineers in Tel Aviv built bigger and better bugs, Al-
exander wanted to attract the rapidly expanding U.S. intelligence com-
munity. He thus placed the former NSA director Lieutenant General Ken
Minihan on the company's "security committee" and soon the NSA and
other parts of the spy world were signing on. Then came the contract
to install its machines at the heart of the Verizon network, the nation's
second-largest telecom company. The Verint system chosen was STAR-
GATE.
  "With STAR-GATE," says the company's sales literature, "service
providers can access communications on virtually any type of network,
retain communication data for as long as required, and query and deliver
content and data . . . Designed to manage vast numbers of targets, con-
current sessions, call data records, and communications, STAR-GATE
transparently accesses targeted communications without alerting sub-
scribers or disrupting service. Verint partners with leading switch and
network equipment vendors across the globe to deliver passive, active,
and hybrid solutions for a wide range of communication services and
communication technologies . . . STAR-GATE can easily be customized
to operate with any switch or storage platform type, model, or software
version and can be easily integrated into any environment. Its modular
architecture facilitates simple upgrade or adaptation to meet the demands
of new communication protocols and technologies."
   During a conference call with investors, company president and CEO
Dan Bodner gave some examples of how customers used the company's
mass interception equipment. One sounded like the NSA: "A multimillion-
dollar expansion order for our Communications Interception Solution for
an international government agency customer. This government customer
is deploying our solution to enhance national security by improving its
ability to intercept information, collect it from wireless, wireline, and
cable networks." Another sounded like Verizon. "Examples of recent or-


                                          240

                                W I R E T A P P E R S

ders for Verint's STAR-GATE solution for service providers include . . . a
multimillion-dollar expansion order for a U.S. wireless service provider."
Another could be Mexico or another of Verint's one hundred country cus-
tomers. "An order for our Communications Interception Solution for a
new government agency customer in a new country for Verint. This new
customer is deploying our solution country-wide to enhance the national
security by intercepting and analyzing mass amounts of voice and data
collected from wireless networks."
   Thus, by 2004, a large percentage of America's--and the world's--
voice and data communications were passing through wiretaps built,
installed, and maintained by a small, secretive Israeli company run by
former Israeli military and intelligence officers. Even more unnerving is
the fact that Verint can automatically access the mega-terabytes of stored
and real-time data secretly and remotely from anywhere, including Israel.
This was revealed in a closed-door hearing in Australia, another one of
Verint's customers. The hearing was held because Verint's system had
been called "a lemon" by the Australian government and they were about
to get rid of it. In a last-minute attempt to salvage the contract, company
executives flew to Australia to plead their case.
    One of the problems that most concerned a government watchdog
group, the Corruption and Crime Commission (CCC) Subcommittee,
was the fact that while they themselves had difficulty getting access to
the intercepted data, Verint was accessing the data remotely from thou-
sands of miles away. "The CCC," said subcommittee member Graham
Giffard, "has some issues," including "the fact that your company is for-
eign owned . . . and that you can access data from overseas but the CCC
seems restricted in its ability to access data within that system." Zvi Fis-
chler, the company's Tel Aviv­based vice president for marketing and
sales, admitted the company conducts such activities. "We sometimes
operate by remote access," he said. "We connect to the system from re-
mote in order to download some software." The explanation didn't seem
to satisfy the Australian officials, however, and Fischler agreed to stop.
"If the CCC finds it inappropriate to allow such access, we will of course
not do it this way," he said.
   At the time, Verint in Australia was tapping only phone calls, but Fis-
chler offered to expand the monitoring system to include the Internet.
"Specifically addressing additional capacity," he said, "one issue could be


                                        241

                         B O O K T H R E E : C O O P E R A T I O N

increasing the capacity in terms of number of interceptions. That is easily
done. It could be done in a matter of a few weeks. Another upgrade that
has already been offered is to increase the capacity to intercept different
types of traffic that [are] not intercepted now. I mentioned broadband In-
ternet access from the Internet service providers. We have indeed offered
this kind of capacity increase."
  While Verint can provide mass interception of data and phone calls,
one of its Israeli spinoffs, PerSay, can go one step further and offer "ad-
vanced voice mining." The company, based in Tel Aviv, employs a sys-
tem "that efficiently searches for a target's voice within a large volume
of intercepted calls, regardless of the conversation content or method
of communication." Thus, with remote access to the internal and inter-
national voice and data communications of over one hundred countries
around the world, including the United States, Verint's headquarters in
Tel Aviv has a capability rivaled only by NSA's, if not greater, especially
when coupled with PerSay's voice-mining capability.
   PerSay is an example of how close and interconnected these compa-
nies are with Israel's intelligence community--a factor of great concern
considering how much of their bugging equipment is now secretly hard-
wired into the American telecommunications system. Among those on
PerSay's board of directors is Arik Nir, a former senior official in Shin
Bet, Israel's internal security service. Nir is also the managing director of
PerSay's financial backer, Athlone Global Security, which counts former
Mossad chief Ephraim Halevy on its advisory board. Athlone was one
of the companies in the NSA's "incubator," the Chesapeake Innovation
Center in Annapolis, Maryland.
  Although there is no evidence of cooperation, the greatest potential
beneficiaries of this marriage between the Israeli eavesdroppers and
America's increasingly centralized telecom grid are Israel's intelligence
agencies. "There is a huge, aggressive, ongoing set of Israeli [intelli-
gence] activities directed against the United States," a former intelligence
official told Los Angeles Times reporters Bob Drogin and Greg Miller
in 2004. "Anybody who worked in counterintelligence in a professional
capacity will tell you the Israelis are among the most aggressive and ac-
tive countries targeting the United States." The former official discounted
repeated Israeli denials that the country exceeded acceptable limits to
obtain information. "They undertake a wide range of technical operations


                                          242

                               W I R E T A P P E R S

and human operations," he said. "The denials are laughable." In 2005,
Lawrence A. Franklin, a senior Pentagon official, pled guilty to spying
for Israel, and in 2008 two top officials of Israel's U.S. lobby, AIPAC, are
scheduled for trial on similar charges.
   The agency responsible for worldwide eavesdropping in Israel is the
hypersecret Unit 8200, that country's NSA. "Unit 8200 is the technol-
ogy intel unit of the Israeli Defense Forces Intelligence Corps," said Unit
veteran Gil Kerbs. "In Israel," he said, "one's academic past is somehow
less important than the military past. One of the questions asked in every
job interview is: Where did you serve in the army? . . . When it comes
to high-tech jobs, nothing can help you more than the sentence, `I'm an
8200 alumnus.' "
   According to a former chief of Unit 8200, both the veterans of the
group and much of the high-tech intelligence equipment they developed
are now employed in high-tech firms around the world. "Cautious esti-
mates indicate that in the past few years," he told a reporter for the Israeli
newspaper Ha'aretz in 2000, "Unit 8200 veterans have set up some 30
to 40 high-tech companies, including 5 to 10 that were floated on Wall
Street." Referred to only as "Brigadier General B," he added, "This corre-
lation between serving in the intelligence unit 8200 and starting success-
ful high-tech companies is not coincidental. Many of the technologies
in use around the world and developed in Israel were originally military
technologies and were developed and improved by Unit veterans." Hav-
ing both trained alumni of the organization and sophisticated eavesdrop-
ping equipment developed by Unit 8200 in foreign countries would be an
enormous intelligence windfall, should Israel be able to harness it.
   Retired Brigadier General Hanan Gefen, a former commander of Unit
8200, noted his former organization's influence on Comverse, which
owns Verint, as well as other Israeli companies that dominate the U.S.
eavesdropping and surveillance market. "Take NICE, Comverse and
Check Point for example, three of the largest high-tech companies, which
were all directly influenced by 8200 technology," said Gefen. "Check
Point was founded by Unit alumni. Comverse's main product, the Logger,
is based on the Unit's technology."
   Check Point, a large Israeli-based company that sells firewalls and
other Internet security software from an office in Redwood City, Califor-
nia, was founded by Unit 8200 veteran Gil Shwed. Today the four years


                                       243

he spent in the Unit go virtually unmentioned in his official biography.
In 2006, the company attempted to acquire the firm Sourcefire, whose
intrusion-prevention technology is used to protect the computer assets of
both the Pentagon and NSA. Because of the potential for espionage, the
deal set off alarm bells at the NSA and FBI and it was eventually killed
by the Committee on Foreign Investments in the U.S., an oversight board.
Alan T. Sherman, a specialist in information assurance at the University
of Maryland, Baltimore County, noted the potential for "information war-
fare" was likely. "It's easy to hide malicious [software] code. Sometimes
it just takes a few lines of malicious code to subvert a system." Neverthe-
less, despite the fact that many of the NSA's and the Pentagon's sensitive
communications--like those of the rest of the country--travel across the
tapping equipment of Verint and Narus, their links to Israel seem to have
slipped below the radar.
   The large Israeli firm NICE, like Verint and Narus, is also a major
eavesdropper in the U.S., and like the other two, it keeps its government
and commercial client list very secret. A key member of the Wiretappers'
Ball, it was formed in 1986 by seven veterans of Unit 8200, according
to the company's founder, Benny Levin. "We were seven people from
the Unit," he said, "we all worked on a project for more than four years,
we knew each other very well. We had very good complementary skills."
Like a page out of Orwell, all their high-tech bugging systems are called
"Nice." Nice Perform, for example, "provides voice content analysis with
features such as: word spotting, emotion detection, talk pattern analysis,
and state-of-the-art visualization techniques." Nice Universe "captures
voice, email, chat, screen activity, and essential call details." Nice Log of-
fers "audio compression technology that performs continuous recordings
of up to thousands of analog and digital telephone lines and radio chan-
nels." And Nice VoIP "can use both packet sniffing and active recording
methods for recording VoIP sessions (both by telephone and Internet)."
    In 2006, Yiar Cohen, a brigadier general who served as head of Unit
8200 from 2000 to 2005, became chairman of the board of the Israeli
company ECtel. Two years earlier, Verint had purchased that company's
"government surveillance business" for $35 million. According to SEC
documents filed by ECtel, "Our surveillance solutions enabled govern-
mental agencies to perform real-time, comprehensive surveillance on
telecommunications networks. We sold this business to Verint Systems in


                                          244

                                 W I R E T A P P E R S

March 2004." Verint said of the purchase, "The acquisition will provide
Verint with additional communications interception capabilities for the
mass collection and analysis of voice and data communications . . . These
technologies will be integrated into Verint's portfolio of communications
interception solutions and offered to Verint's global customer base."
   That base, said Verint, included "new customers in new countries for
Verint in the Asia Pacific and Latin America regions." Dan Bodner, presi-
dent and CEO of Verint, noted the long and close relationship with ECtel.
"We have been working with ECtel as a partner for a number of years and
our knowledge of their products and familiarity with their employees will
better enable us to integrate ECtel's communications interception busi-
ness with Verint's operations."
   ECtel's Cohen, who was head of Unit 8200 at the time of the 9/11 at-
tacks, is also vice president of another Israeli telecom company, Elron.
He noted the importance of placing veteran electronic spies from Unit
8200 in Israeli high-tech firms. "I think there's an axiomatic assumption
that Unit alumni are people who bring with them very high personal and
intellectual ability," he said. "They have a common background, and they
know that 8200 has the privilege of sorting, choosing, and selecting the
best group so that you don't have to invest so much in the selection your-
self. I myself, after I came to Elron, brought five additional alumni with
me." The ultimate winner in such an arrangement, according to Cohen,
was Israel's economy. "Although 8200 doesn't directly enjoy the fruits,
the state of Israel does, and in my opinion that's a complementary part of
the Unit's task."
   Unit 8200's revolving door with industry appears similar to that of the
NSA. As both electronic intelligence organizations grow ever more de-
pendent on the corporate world to conduct their eavesdropping, the line
between government and industrial espionage blurs. This presents great
opportunity for co-mingling personnel.
   Similar to Verint, Narus was formed in November 1997 by five Israelis,
with much of its money coming from Walden Israel, an Israeli venture
capital company. At the time, most of the founders were working for the
Israeli company VDOnet, which specialized in live video broadcasts on
the Internet. Based in the Israeli city of Herzliya, the company also had
offices in the Silicon Valley town of Palo Alto, California, not far from
where Narus planted its flag in Mountain View. Among the five was Stan-

islav Khirman, a husky, bearded Russian who earned degrees in math
at Ukrainian universities from 1980 to 1988. The next four years of his
résumé are blank, but in 1992 he began working for Elta Systems, Inc. A
division of Israel Aerospace Industries, Ltd., Elta specializes in develop-
ing advanced eavesdropping systems for Israeli defense and intelligence
organizations. At Narus, Khirman became the chief technology officer.
   Among the group of Israelis, Ori Cohen, a balding, dark-haired engi-
neer with a PhD in physics from Imperial College in London, became
president and chairman. He had spent a few years as CEO of IntelliCom
Ltd., a company of which there is no record, and then became vice presi-
dent of business and technology development at VDOnet with Khirman.
That is all the information he has ever released about himself and, like
Khirman, he makes no mention of his Israeli military service, if any. It
seems the man whose system invades the privacy of hundreds of millions
of Americans tries very hard to keep his own. Chief executive officer of
Narus is Greg Oslan, who previously worked for a company owned by
Haim Harel, an Israeli who spent much of his career specializing in elec-
tronic intelligence systems at the large Israeli defense firm Tadiran.
   Thus, virtually the entire American telecommunications system is
bugged by two Israeli-formed companies with possible ties to Israel's
eavesdropping agency--with no oversight by Congress.
   Also troubling are Verint's extremely close ties to the FBI's central
wiretapping office, known as the CALEA Implementation Section (CIS).
The CIS had long fought for greater access to the telecommunications
switches--the same switches that Verint was tapping. The action by CIS
was strongly resisted by the telecom industry and privacy groups who
argued that the bureau was attempting to greatly exceed its legal mandate.
"The FBI is committing the kind of dirty tricks more characteristic of
scofflaws than cops," said a commentary in the industry publication Wire-
less Week. Taking aim at an FBI-crafted amendment to the wiretapping
law, the article warned, "The proposed amendment would have created
frightening police powers to track wireless users and prevented judicial
or regulatory review of FBI compliance methods for telecommunications
carriers." Al Gidari, a lawyer representing the wireless industry, said the
FBI's list of requirements amounted to "the Cadillac of wiretaps." He
added, "Everything they could ever think of to gold plate and put on the
Cadillac was in that document."

   The head of the FBI's liaison office with the telecom industry during
much of the period leading up to implementation was David Worthley.
What concerns many in the industry is that shortly after Worthley was
removed from his liaison job in June 1997, he turned up as president of
the Verint unit that sold its eavesdropping equipment and services to the
FBI, NSA, and other agencies. The company set up its offices in Chan-
tilly, Virginia--directly next door to the CIS and Worthley's old office.
Thus, the company that secretly taps much of the country's telecommuni-
cations is now very closely tied to the agency constantly seeking greater
access to the switches. This concern over the cozy relationship between
the bureau and Verint greatly increased following disclosure of the Bush
administration's warrantless eavesdropping operations. At the same time
that the tappers and the agents have grown uncomfortably close, the pre-
vious checks and balances, such as the need for a FISA warrant, have
been eliminated.
   But as earphone-clad FBI agents were listening for terrorists and
criminals through Verint's taps, top executives from the company and its
parent, Comverse, were themselves engaging in an orgy of theft, bribery,
money laundering, and other crimes.
   For Kobi Alexander, chairman of Verint and CEO of Comverse, sum-
mers meant vacation and vacation often meant visiting relatives in Is-
rael. Thus on June 28, 2006, as fierce rainstorms swept up and down the
mid-Atlantic region, he, his wife, and their young daughter headed for
Kennedy International Airport and a flight on El Al Airlines to sunny Tel
Aviv. But unlike other trips back to his homeland, this time he sent ahead
some extra cash: $57 million. Also unlike other vacations, this time it was
going to be a one-way trip.
   For Alexander, the storm clouds had been hovering overhead for
months. On the other side of Manhattan, the Justice Department was in
the final stages of preparing a thirty-two-count indictment charging him
with masterminding a scheme to backdate millions of Comverse stock
options. It was a crime, prosecutors say, that allowed Alexander to realize
$138 million in profits--profits stolen from the pockets of the company's
shareholders. The indictment also named as co-conspirators Comverse
chief financial officer David Kreinberg, forty-one, and general counsel
William Sorin, fifty-six. In addition, the trio of executives was accused
of creating a secret slush fund to distribute options to favored employees,


                                        247

                        B O O K T H R E E : C O O P E R A T I O N

options that could be exercised overnight for millions in profits. For Al-
exander, the charges had the potential of putting him away in prison for
as long as twenty-five years, and leveling fines and penalties of more than
$150 million.
   To many who knew him, Alexander was the poster child for arrogance
and greed. "The one thing about Kobi is that he did have a sense of en-
titlement," said Stephen R. Kowarsky, a former colleague. "Most people
are a little bit shy or self-effacing about asking for something, but not
Kobi. It was easy for him to say, `I want that. I deserve that.' "
   In 2001, Alexander was the fourth most overpaid CEO in the U.S. tele-
com industry, making six times his deserved salary, in the view of the
Bloomberg News columnist Graef Crystal. That year his compensation
totaled $102.5 million, including $93.1 million in exercised stock op-
tions. The year before, he cashed in an additional $80 million worth of
options. Plus, until such actions were outlawed by the Sarbanes-Oxley
Act of 2002, he had packed the board with his father, Zvi Alexander,
and his sister, Shaula Alexander Yemini--who conveniently sat on the
board's remuneration and stock option committee. Yet despite their enor-
mous wealth, around their luxury West 57th Street high-rise, where they
owned several condominiums and counted Goldie Hawn, Paul Allen, and
Al Pacino as neighbors, Kobi and his wife, Hana, were known as notori-
ously bad tippers. "They'd give us like $10 or $20 or $30 as a tip for the
holidays," scowled one worker at the building.
   Alexander's sense of entitlement extended to escaping punishment.
Knowing he was likely to be indicted, he resigned his positions at Verint
and Comverse on May 1, 2006. Then, according to the Justice Depart-
ment, Alexander offered a Comverse colleague $2 million to take the
blame and serve the prison time on his behalf. When that wasn't enough,
he upped the offer to $5 million, and then simply "told the individual he
can name his own price." But no offer was high enough, so Alexander
went to Plan B, fleeing to Israel with his family and transferring $57 mil-
lion from his bank in New York to an account in Israel.
   Alexander believed Israel had become a safe haven for wealthy crooks
with ethnic or religious ties to the country, including Marc Rich, the busi-
ness associate of his father. Also taking refuge from the law in Israel
was Leonid Nevzlin, the former deputy CEO of OAO Yukos Oil Com-
pany, who was facing tax evasion and murder conspiracy charges in Rus-


                                         248

                               W I R E T A P P E R S

sia. Another was Pincus Green, like Rich a commodities trader charged
with tax evasion in the U.S. Still another was Eddie Antar, the founder
of the "Crazy Eddie" chain of electronics stores, who was charged with
fraud and racketeering by the SEC. He was located in Israel following
an intensive two-year international manhunt, but he asserted his Israeli
citizenship and was allowed to stay. "He was Jewish, and the Israelis
didn't want to extradite someone who was Jewish," said Jayne Blumberg,
a former federal prosecutor in Newark who investigated and prosecuted
the case. Antar, however, eventually decided against fighting extradition
procedures and was returned to the U.S.
  While Israel would be safe for a time, there were no guarantees it
would remain that way; the country did have an extradition treaty with
the U.S., and in both countries Alexander was a very high-profile figure.
Thus, soon after his arrival he began intensively researching nations with-
out an extradition agreement with the American government and, after a
process of elimination, settled on the southwest African country of Na-
mibia. Remote, sparsely populated, made up mostly of the bleak Kalahari
Desert, it was also seemingly immune from the long arm of the FBI. On
July 18, ten days before he was scheduled to return to New York from his
vacation, he flew to the Namibian capital of Windhoek. A century earlier,
the city was the seat of power in the German colony of South West Africa,
and the country's influence was still very apparent in the architecture as
well as the food. In addition to local dishes, most menus listed venison
and sauerkraut as well as locally brewed beer.
   It was the middle of the African winter and the days were mild when
Alexander stepped off the plane at Windhoek Hosea Kutako International
Airport. After making some initial contacts, he flew back to Israel and
continued pushing his attorneys to negotiate a deal with federal prosecu-
tors to avoid criminal charges. But in a July 21 conversation, the prosecu-
tors would only agree to meet Alexander at JFK Airport and not arrest
him at that time. Alexander agreed and provided evidence that he was
ticketed on an El Al flight arriving in New York on July 28. But on July
27, he and his family instead flew from Tel Aviv to Frankfurt, Germany,
where they transferred to Lufthansa for a nonstop flight to Windhoek.
   After showing their Israeli passports, the Alexanders took a taxi to the
posh Hotel Thule in Eros, a nearby suburb. Located high on a hill above
Windhoek, the hotel offered vistas of the city below and the low-slung


                                       249

                        B O O K T H R E E : C O O P E R A T I O N

mountains in the distance. Flanked by stately palm trees, with guinea
fowl and rock rabbits crawling about, it must have seemed a world away
from their 57th Street apartment. The hotel literature boasted that Thule
was "a mythical place . . . at the frontier of reality--the edge of the world."
Alexander no doubt hoped so, but he must also have liked the part of the
brochure that said the hotel was "an exclusive getaway."
   Under the sheltering canopy of blue sky in Namibia, the staff of the
Hotel Thule had no idea there was an international manhunt for their new
guest. Nor did they think it suspicious that he shunned credit cards and
paid cash in advance for two adjoining ground-floor rooms at $143 each
a night. "We knew them as the Family Jacobs, that's how the booking
agency gave it to us," said manager Wolfgang Balzer. "Alexander always
looked very busy, and he insisted that the news channel on the satellite
decoder always work. He was very anxious about that . . . I thought being
from Israel, he was worried about Lebanon and all that."
  Alexander bought a $107,000 Land Cruiser and began looking for a
place to live. At the end of August he settled on Windhoek Country Club
Estate, a gated community of fifty-seven block-style town houses that back
up to the Windhoek Golf Course on the outskirts of the city. The family
moved into number 19, a modern, five-thousand-square-foot, two-story
house he purchased for $543,000. In the shadow of the Auas Mountains,
the tan-colored house had a satellite dish perched on the roof and a bas-
ketball hoop hanging from the garage. Next door to the complex was the
Desert Jewel Casino, which featured American roulette, stud poker, black-
jack, and 290 slot machines. But perhaps the most important feature of the
house was its proximity to Eros Airport, a private airstrip only about two
hundred meters away, in the event he needed another quick escape.
  Alexander knew it was only a matter of time before he was discovered
and the United States began putting pressure on the Namibian government
to toss him out. He therefore began investing large sums of money with
powerful officials connected to the government, and making high-profile
contributions to local civic projects. For Kobi Alexander, everyone had a
price, a lesson he learned from his father's years of backroom payoffs to
petty African officials for oil rights. After transferring about $16 million
to a bank account in Namibia, he launched into a frenzy of investments
and goodwill gestures, from developing $1.5 million in low-cost housing
to $20,000 in yearly high school scholarships.

  Alexander's principal business partners included Brigadier Mathias
Sciweda of the Namibia Defence Force, who headed up the army's com-
mercial arm and was known to be close to Namibia's powerful former
president, Sam Nujoma. The two bought a number of properties, includ-
ing one encompassing thirteen acres at Walvis Bay. In 2005, Sciweda's
name had come up in a Namibian financial scandal involving an invest-
ment by Namibia's Social Security Commission of $4.3 million in a failed
asset-management firm. Sciweda was named by the head of the firm to be
among the shareholders. But he later testified that he never received any
money from the firm.
   On the other side of the world, when Alexander failed to show up
at JFK Airport on July 28, the Justice Department immediately filed a
criminal complaint charging him, Kreinberg, and Sorin with dozens of
counts of fraud and other crimes. But instead of making the document
public, they placed it under seal; thinking no charges had yet been filed,
he might return voluntarily. Alexander, however, had no intention of ever
returning to America and on July 31 attempted to transfer another $12
million out of his U.S. bank. By then, however, his remaining $50 million
had been frozen by the prosecutors.
   By August 9, the Justice Department concluded that Alexander was on
the run and unsealed the indictment. At a press conference in Washington
that day, Deputy Attorney General Paul J. McNulty made the dramatic
announcement. "Three former executives of Comverse Technology," he
said, "were charged today for their roles in orchestrating a long-running
scheme to manipulate the grant of millions of Comverse stock options to
themselves and to employees. Former chief executive officer Jacob `Kobi'
Alexander, former chief financial officer David Kreinberg, and former
general counsel William F. Sorin allegedly orchestrated the scheme by
fraudulently backdating the options and operating a secret stock options
slush fund. An arrest warrant has been issued for Alexander." Acting
assistant FBI director James "Chip" Burrus then added, "The alleged
scheme of these defendants in backdating options victimized both Com-
verse shareholders and the American people."
  The FBI slapped Alexander's face on its Most Wanted list and Interpol
sent out a global "Red Notice" asking all cooperating countries to arrest
him if he showed up at their border. Both Kreinberg and Sorin were ar-
raigned in Brooklyn federal court within hours of the press conference


                                      251

and later pled guilty and faced prison sentences and millions of dollars in
fines and penalties. Comverse and Verint were dumped from the Nasdaq
Stock Market.
   For a while, Alexander seemed safe. But as the millions began flowing
into his Windhoek bank account, the transfers raised the suspicions of the
country's bank regulatory agency and they notified Interpol. A few days
later, on August 18, Interpol asked Namibian authorities to investigate
whether Alexander was in the country. Within hours they reported back
that he was and, at the request of the American government, Namibia's
extradition laws were ordered changed to include the United States. The
addition was approved by Namibia's president, Hifikepunye Pohamba,
on August 31, but because it would take about a month for the modifica-
tion to go into effect, it was decided not to alert Alexander. Two days
earlier he had been granted a two-year work permit.
   On September 27, the new extradition law went into effect and the
news was reported in the local paper. Before Alexander could escape
again, police arrested him at his home as he was having lunch with his
wife and daughter. "He got very nervous when we handcuffed him," Na-
mibia's chief inspector, William Lloyd, recalled. "He could see there was
something serious coming at him." Placed in a patrol car, he was taken
to Windhoek Central Prison, a desolate, overcrowded fortress encircled
by razor wire and high-voltage electrified fences. There he was tossed
into H-Section, where the average cell was packed with as many as thirty
inmates. It was a long, hard fall for the man who had bugged America--
and the world.
   It was also a troubling insight into just how vulnerable America's voice
and data communications systems have become. Unknown to the public,
an entire national telecom network was channeled through a powerful
foreign-made bug controlled by a corrupt foreign-based company with
close links to a foreign electronic spy agency. As of 2008, the bug was
still there and the only thing that had changed was a reshuffling of the
company's top management.
   Kobi Alexander's stay in prison was short; after six days he was re-
leased on $1.4 million in bail--the largest in the history of the coun-
try--and he has remained free ever since. As he keeps pumping tens of
millions of dollars into Namibia's weak economy his extradition keeps
getting pushed back further and further. "It looks like he's trying to influ-

ence the politics of Namibia to keep him there," said Patrick Dahlstrom,
an attorney representing the financially harmed shareholders. Nonsense,
replied Alexander's attorney, Richard Metcalfe, who saw no correlation
between his client's newfound sense of generosity and his desire to stay
in Namibia and out of an American prison. "I think it's typical of Kobi
Alexander," he said. "I think it's part of that great Jewish ethos of gen-
erosity, of displaying generosity toward other people when you're doing
well and when things go well with you. And I think that's part of the man
and part of his psyche to be generous to people."

N   ot only have Narus and Verint tapped virtually the entire American
    telecom system, between the two firms they have also wired much
of the planet for sound--democracies as well as dictatorships, it doesn't
seem to make any difference. Never before in history have so few peo-
ple wiretapped so many. From China to America and from Europe to
Southeast Asia and Australia, countries use Verint and Narus equipment
to eavesdrop on--and in many cases repress--their citizens. Verint, for
example, was the company that won the contract to build a secret nation-
wide eavesdropping system for the government of Mexico.
  Verint's long list of customers also includes Vietnam, a place where the
government makes no bones about eavesdropping on domestic communi-
cations, and putting in jail anyone caught opposing its policies. All Inter-
net service providers (ISPs) there are state owned and they are required
to provide technical assistance and workspace to public security agents to
allow them to monitor Internet activities. The government also requires
Internet agents, such as cybercafés, to register the personal information
of their customers, store records of Internet sites visited by customers for
thirty days, and cooperate with public security officials.
   In July 2006, about the time Verint was taking Vietnam on as a client,
the Ministry of Post and Telematics instructed all ISPs to install in their
Internet kiosks new control software designed to record information on
users and their Internet behavior and send the information to the ISPs'
servers to be stored for a year. The software also contained an identifica-


                                    254

                              T E C H N O T Y R A N N Y

tion system that allows ISPs to identify the user and what the user does
during an Internet session. To use Internet kiosks, customers must pro-
vide personal details to acquire a user name and password--both issued
and controlled by the ISP. Customers then can use the issued user name
and password to browse the Internet. In addition, at least some home In-
ternet subscribers had all Internet usage monitored by the newly installed
software and hardware system.
   The new system worked well. On March 11, 2007, police raided a cy-
bercafé and arrested an Internet user in Hanoi while he was taking part in
a discussion forum on democracy. By the end of the year, his status was
still unknown. Then, using the new equipment, the government installed
firewalls to block websites that it deemed politically or culturally inap-
propriate, including sites operated by exile groups abroad. The govern-
ment occasionally restricted access to the Radio Free Asia and Voice of
America websites, as well as sites operated by overseas dissident groups.
Among those affected were local newspapers that occasionally wrote sto-
ries based on RFA broadcasts. Finally, the government required owners
of domestic websites, including those operated by foreign entities, to reg-
ister their sites with the government and submit their website content to
the government for approval.
   Among those who must now watch his words is Le Quoc Quan, a po-
litical dissident who spends much of his time looking for safe places to
talk about his opposition to the regime in power. He is far from paranoid;
in 2007, Quan, a lawyer, was carted away to prison for one hundred days
on suspicion of passing information to the CIA.
    So pervasive is the new commercially available Internet censorship
technology that dissidents are now arrested in Internet cafés, and state
security agents show up at homes to seize computers. Around the same
time Quan was arrested, the country's supreme court sentenced two other
cyber-dissidents to jail for terms of three and four years for transmitting
over the Internet "anti-government propaganda." To avoid the cyber-goons,
Quan and a number of other protesters turned to VoIP. By communicat-
ing by phone over the Internet, their data packets become much harder to
capture and their conversations are therefore more secure.
   Among the most popular VoIP systems is Skype, which is a revolu-
tion in telecommunications. Not only are Skype calls cheap and easy to
make, they are also virtually unbuggable--and the best way to defeat


                                        255

                        B O O K T H R E E : C O O P E R A T I O N

Narus, Verint, and even the NSA. The company, acquired by eBay, Inc.,
provides free voice calls and instant messaging between users. There is
a fee to talk to nonmembers. But the most unique feature is its security,
which is achieved by end-to-end encryption for all calls to other members.
Such technology makes it possible to fight back against the proliferating
eavesdropping factories.
   Skype and other VoIP calls have become life preservers for dissidents
such as Quan in repressive countries around the world. The technology
gives them the freedom necessary to plan demonstrations, enlist support-
ers, and organize meetings. "It's great. Amazing," says Quan. "Talking by
phone is absolutely not safe in Vietnam. This way we can communicate
more securely." Another option to further evade the authorities is to say
parts of the message over the VoIP connection and then simultaneously
write other parts on the Internet. Another advantage lies simply in the
numbers--in 2007, there were about 17.9 million Internet users in Viet-
nam, nearly 21 percent of the country. "We can connect to a whole new
generation," says Nguyen Thanh Giang, a seventy-one-year-old scholar
and dissident who avoids the police patrols constantly watching his house
by communicating over Skype. "More and more people are joining up."
  The need for such protection is clear. In 2006, five dissident writers
were jailed for planning to publish the newsletter Tu Do Dan Chu ("Free-
dom and Democracy"). About the same time another cyber-dissident,
Truong Quoc Huy, twenty-five, who had spent nearly nine months in jail
with his brother for chatting on a pro-democracy Internet forum, was re-
arrested. The list of similar arrests is long, and Quan and Giang's days of
dissent may, like that of Huy and his brother, be over. Verint's deal placed
in the hands of the Vietnamese government the technology to block all
VoIP calls from the Internet. This would force the dissidents to either use
the monitored phone lines or the tapped Internet, both subject to Verint's
intrusive technology.
  The initial agreement between Verint and Vietnam's security chief in
the Ministry of the Interior took place in 2002 and included two P-GSM
stations, portable mobile phone listening devices, at $250,000 each. Since
then, the company's involvement with the Communist government has
grown substantially. Another company involved in the sale was Silver
Bullet, a European company, and two Israeli companies acted as inter-
mediaries. A few years later, the press freedom organization Reporters


                                         256

                               T E C H N O T Y R A N N Y

Without Borders discovered the deal. For years the group had focused
closely on Vietnam's harsh treatment of journalists and dissidents and
they quickly issued a strong protest. "We are appalled to learn that our
phone calls with Vietnamese cyber-dissidents have been monitored with
equipment provided by European and U.S. companies," the organization
said. "Coming a year after it emerged that Yahoo! cooperates with the
Chinese police, this new case reinforces our conviction that telecommu-
nications companies must be forced to respect certain rules of ethical
conduct. In particular, they should be banned from selling surveillance
equipment to repressive governments."
   Although Verint refused to confirm the deal with the Vietnamese gov-
ernment, in 2002 it had issued a press release saying the company had
been "selected to provide law enforcement communications interception
solutions to a new customer in Asia Pacific," for "more than $1.5 million"
but chose not to mention the name of the country. The system sounded
very similar to the widespread surveillance network it installed in Mexico.
"Verint Systems," said the July 8, 2002, release, "a leading provider of ana-
lytic solutions for communications interception, digital video security and
surveillance, and enterprise business intelligence . . . will provide a com-
munications interception solution, including the `front-end' interception
system installed within the communications network of the service pro-
vider and the `back-end' monitoring center used by multiple law enforce-
ment agencies to collect and analyze intercepted communications from the
specific network . . . Verint's software, which is used by over 800 organi-
zations in over 50 countries worldwide, generates actionable intelligence
through the collection, retention and analysis of voice, fax, video, email,
Internet and data transmissions from multiple communications networks."
   In 2007, First Consulting Group (FCG) Vietnam listed Verint as one
of their key clients in Vietnam. "Verint is a leading global provider of
Actionable Intelligence Software and Services," it said, adding that the
company had been "engaged with FCG Vietnam for almost 4 years." As
a sign of how much the company had grown in the country, FCG Vietnam
noted that Verint had "started with 5 resources [personnel]; current team
is over 120 resources."
   Like Verint, Narus is branching out, looking to install its powerful tap-
ping equipment deep within the world's telecommunications infrastructure.
And also like its competitor, Narus has focused much of its attention on


                                         257

                         B O O K T H R E E : C O O P E R A T I O N

repressive countries, including China, with its forty million Internet us-
ers. "Narus' carrier-class IP platform is the first and only foreign IP man-
agement and security system ever certified by us," said Wang Haisheng,
director of China's Internet police, the Information Technology Security
Certification Center. "Narus' approach to IP data capture, analysis and
management provides telecom carriers with a total network view to protect
their network infrastructure. After months of rigorous testing and evalua-
tion, Narus' solution proved to meet our stringent IT security criteria." The
Chinese government implanted Narus in all its telecommunication organi-
zations including China Telecom, China Netcom, China Mobile, and China
Unicom. The services included "traffic analysis" and "interception."
  The Narus spy equipment has had a devastating effect. According to
a report by the State Department, "The authorities reportedly began to
employ more sophisticated technology enabling the selective blocking of
specific content rather than entire Web sites. Such technology was also
used to block e-mails containing sensitive content . . . New restrictions
aimed at increasing government control over the Internet included stricter
Web site registration requirements, enhanced official control of online
content, and an expanded definition of illegal online content. The coun-
try's Internet control system reportedly employed tens of thousands of
persons. The government consistently blocked access to sites it deemed
controversial, such as sites discussing Taiwan and Tibetan independence,
underground religious and spiritual organizations, democracy activists,
and the 1989 Tiananmen massacre. The government also at times blocked
access to selected sites operated by major foreign news outlets, health or-
ganizations, and educational institutions."
   In Shanghai, like in Vietnam, dissidents once used VoIP to avoid gov-
ernment-owned Shanghai Telecom's 6.2 million landlines--until the
company installed the Narus software to prevent such calls and track them
down. Now the dissidents face the same fate as their Vietnamese counter-
parts. Elsewhere in China in 2006, the dozens of Internet arrests included
the former Fuzhou Daily journalist and Internet essayist Li Changqing,
who was sentenced to three years in prison for "spreading alarmist infor-
mation." His Internet articles supported jailed corruption whistleblower
Huang Jingao. A few months later, the Internet essayist Yang Tongyan
was sentenced to twelve years in prison for posting on overseas websites
articles calling for the release of Chinese dissidents. About the same time,


                                          258

                               T E C H N O T Y R A N N Y

the Internet author Guo Qizhen was sentenced to four years' imprison-
ment on the charge of "inciting subversion of state power." By 2008, fifty-
one cyber-dissidents and thirty-five journalists were sitting in Chinese
prisons, according to Reporters Without Borders.
   Narus has also quietly sold similar equipment to many of the most
repressive governments of the Middle East, from Pakistan to Egypt to
Saudi Arabia to Libya, some known to torture opponents. In 2005, Narus
announced "a multimillion-dollar agreement with Giza Systems of Egypt,
licensing Narus' comprehensive portfolio of IP management and security
products in the Middle East region. Giza Systems, a world-class systems
provider of telecommunications solutions in the Middle East, delivers
IP management and security solutions in Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Palestine,
and Libya using the Narus system. Narus and Giza Systems formalized
this exclusive relationship after working together for more than two years
providing Voice over IP (VoIP) detection, mediation, and protection to the
largest IP carriers in the Middle East. Telecom Egypt and Saudi Telecom
are already benefiting from Narus' carrier-class applications for analysis,
security, monitoring and mediation of IP traffic in combination with Giza
Systems' technical and commercial capabilities."
   According to James Mullins, Narus's vice president of sales for Europe,
the Middle East, and Africa, "Collaborating with a recognized leader in
deploying IP services gives Narus a clear advantage in meeting the needs
of Middle Eastern carriers . . . Teaming up with Giza Systems to target the
Middle East region enables Narus to extend its worldwide leadership posi-
tion in unified IP Management and Security. It ensures that customers get
both the solutions and support for their IP networks that they require."
   Shortly after installing the Narus system, the Egyptian Ministry of
Communications and Information issued a decree asserting the gov-
ernment's right to block, suspend, or shut down any website deemed to
threaten national security. Then on October 30, 2006, Reporters With-
out Borders published a list of thirteen countries it labeled as "enemies
of the Internet," a list that included Vietnam and also Egypt due to the
recent imprisonment of pro-democracy bloggers. On January 27, 2006,
the Egyptian government reportedly had blocked the website Save Egypt
Front (saveegyptfront.org). And on May 7, security forces had arrested
prominent blogger Alaa Seif Al-Islam (www.manalaa.net) and detained
him at Tora Prison until June 22 without charges. Many other bloggers


                                         259

                         B O O K T H R E E : C O O P E R A T I O N

were also arrested and at least one was tortured, according to a U.S. State
Department report.
   Not only is Narus selling interception and VoIP-blocking software to
these countries, it is also selling an extremely intrusive package known as
Forensics. Designed for one of the largest telecommunications networks,
Tier-One, the system enables the owner to do "Web page reconstruction,
playback of VoIP traffic and e-mail reconstruction." An associated pro-
gram called Narus Directed Analysis "provides a flexible, targeting com-
ponent designed to surgically capture traffic around a specific event [such
as a demonstration], anomalous behavior or specific computer. Among
the possible targeting criteria are client identity, server identity, protocol,
network link." These two pieces of software, Narus says, "are currently
deployed in Tier-1 Carrier-Class networks around the world including
Asia and EMEA [Europe, the Middle East and Africa]."
   Not to be outdone, Verint offers its "VANTAGE Mass Interception So-
lutions" for any country interested in total control of its citizens. "Verint
Communications Interception Solutions extract intelligence from virtu-
ally any type of network," its sales literature says. "VANTAGE is a mass
interception system that intercepts, filters and analyzes voice and data for
intelligence purposes, with sophisticated probing technology for collect-
ing maximum communications, Verint's real-time filtering mechanisms
to extract the most important information, and stored data analysis for
generating intelligence from data collected over time. Access sources
range from passive trunk monitoring at the operator's facility to micro-
wave and satellite interception."
   The Verint sales brochure goes on to say:


  VANTAGE features include:


   ·  Mass interception of communications related to specific areas of
      interest
   ·  Passive monitoring of virtually any type of network
   ·  Sophisticated filtering for high-throughput networks and to track
      known targets and network events in real time
   ·  Processing engines to organize mass amounts of collected un-
      structured data into a format that enables rule-based retrieval and
      interactive analysis


                                          260

                              T E C H N O T Y R A N N Y

   ·  Interactive analysis tools, including free text search, visual link
      analysis, location tracking, and reporting
   ·  Built-in support for various intelligence methodologies


   Once the phone calls and Internet activity are captured, Verint gives
its customers the tools to deeply mine the information for whomever or
whatever it is targeting. "DEEPVIEW," says Verint, is a "packet data col-
lection system with the comprehensive functionality to penetrate deep
into communications." It also contains a "powerful decoding engine that
addresses such services as VoIP, email, webmail, chat, web surfing, in-
stant messaging, and more."
   For the companies, marketing their mass interception systems to dic-
tatorships and authoritarian governments to enhance their police states
and to jail opponents is just business. "Once our customers buy our prod-
uct, it's relatively opaque to us," said Steve Bannerman, vice president of
marketing at Narus.
   But while the physicists and engineers at Narus had discovered the key
to secretly intercepting massive amounts of communications, what they
were lacking was an efficient method of picking out the targeted names,
e-mail addresses, and phone numbers and packaging the data for their
customers in the U.S. and overseas. To help them solve that problem, the
company turned to a part-time vintner attempting to grow grapes on a
scruffy patch of tired Nebraska soil. For a company founded by Israelis
and used to the fast-paced life of Silicon Valley, Bennet, Nebraska, popu-
lation 685, was a long way away--both in miles and culture.

I n the summer of 2006, Mike Murman's big concern was getting a permit
  from the Otoe County commissioners for a building to house a grape-
crushing machine for the winery he had been trying to start for six years.
"I call it Glacial Till Vineyards," he said. Murman also wanted permission
for an open-lagoon wastewater treatment system on the premises. A na-
tive Nebraskan from Hastings, Murman, forty-nine, graduated from the
University of Nebraska-Lincoln in 1979 with a degree in business and
marketing and began working for Selection Research, Inc., a Nebraska-
based market research and personnel testing firm, and a few years later
he decided to start up his own company, Measurement Systems Corp. But
because its work was similar to that of Selection Research, the company
sued Murman for his alleged use of trade secrets.
   As the lawsuit dragged on for five years, Murman created a new com-
pany called Pen-Link that developed software to analyze phone call pat-
terns from wiretaps. The company developed computer programs to find
links between the numbers--who's being called by whom, and who they
are calling. "We would give them an automated way to load telephone
records and provide an analysis tool for that information," he said.
   When not acting as an amateur vintner, Murman runs his bugging and
link-analysis firm from its small headquarters at 5936 VanDervoort Drive
in Lincoln, Nebraska, about fifteen miles from Bennet. A regular at the
Wiretappers' Ball, he says Pen-Link has about a hundred large wiretap
installations and thousands of customers, including seven thousand who


                                      262

                                   M I N E R S

are still using the company's first product. The latest products are the
Lincoln System, used in phone taps, and the Predator, for Internet eaves-
dropping. Among his customers are the CIA and a number of other let-
tered government agencies, as well as eight foreign countries, mostly in
Latin America, and he is actively marketing to the Middle East. "Every
government in the world does interception of communications, some law-
fully, some not," Murman candidly admits. "We realized that our growth
shouldn't just be in the United States, but everywhere."
   As for most participants in the Wiretappers' Ball, the Bush adminis-
tration's warrantless eavesdropping program has meant boom times for
Pen-Link. In 2003, the company's sales were $6.9 million; by 2006 they
had grown 121 percent to $15.2 million. Nevertheless, Murman prefers
to keep a low profile. "Nobody knows much about who we are," he says.
"We like being private and under the radar in Lincoln, Nebraska."
   By the summer of 2006, however, Narus was looking for new ways to
mine the data it was collecting and came knocking at Murman's door with
a collaboration deal. Murman accepted and on June 13, Narus announced
"a strategic agreement with Pen-Link, Ltd. to market NarusInsight Inter-
cept Suite software in conjunction with Pen-Link's LINCOLN        ® 2 inter-
cept collection and reporting solution." The announcement said marrying
Narus's powerful intercept capability with Pen-Link's sophisticated anal-
ysis software "combined best-of-breed technologies." Narus also boasted
of its capability to do "deep packet inspection"--the analysis not just of
the address information but of the entire content of traffic. "NarusInsight
is unique in its ability to simultaneously provide deep packet inspection
from layer 3 to layer 7 and complete correlation across every link and
element on the network."
   As the NSA obtained access to virtually all domestic and international
communications through the Narus and Verint bugs, analysts next turned
their focus to mining that information for intelligence.
   What both the NSA and the FBI were most interested in was "link
analysis"--building ever-expanding lists of names emanating outward
from their original target, like circles in a pond from a dropped stone. If
John was the target, who were the people John called the most, what time
were the calls, what was their frequency and their duration? Then each of
these people--John's "community of interest" in NSA lingo--would be
targeted, and on and on like an endless chain letter.


                                     263

                        B O O K T H R E E : C O O P E R A T I O N

   The FBI began flooding the telecoms with emergency "exigent circum-
stances" letters asking for calling records on long lists of targets. "Due
to exigent circumstances it is requested that call detail records for the at-
tached list of telephone numbers be provided," said the letters. "Addition-
ally, please provide a community of interest for the telephone numbers
in the attached list." The operation was conducted from Room 4315, the
Communications Analysis Unit, at FBI headquarters in Washington.
  Verizon alone received over 239,000 "requests and demands for cus-
tomer information" from federal and state officials between January 2005
and September 2007. But because its database was designed simply for
billing purposes, the company was not able to provide the "community
of interest" data requested. According to Randal S. Milch, Verizon's gen-
eral counsel, the company also received requests "containing `boilerplate'
language directing us, for instance, `to identify a "calling circle" for the
foregoing telephone numbers based on a two generation community of
interest; provide related subscriber information.' " In a letter to members
of Congress looking into the requests, Milch said, "Because Verizon does
not maintain such `calling circle' records, we have not provided this in-
formation in response to these requests; we have not analyzed the legal
justification for any such requests, been offered indemnification for any
such requests, or sought our customers' consent to respond to . . . any
such requests."
   One solution to the problem was for the NSA to secretly obtain massive
amounts of current and past billing information from the telecoms and
then use their own personnel and supercomputers to identify the calling
circles around their targets. Because of an FCC rule requiring the telecoms
to keep these records for seven years, there was a vast supply. And because
the NSA was principally interested only in international links, the compa-
nies they approached were AT&T, MCI WorldCom (which later became
part of Verizon), and possibly Sprint. AT&T and MCI apparently agreed.
  "The president's program uses information collected from phone com-
panies," said Senator Kit Bond, the ranking member of the Senate Intelli-
gence Committee. "The phone companies keep their records. They have a
record. And it shows what telephone number called what other telephone
number." Director of National Intelligence Mike McConnell also indi-
cated that the warrantless eavesdropping program was only one program
of many highly secret NSA programs approved by Bush following the


                                         264

                                   M I N E R S

attacks on 9/11. "This is the only aspect of the NSA activities that can be
discussed publicly, because it is the only aspect of those various activities
whose existence has been officially acknowledged," he said.
   For the NSA, the most valuable source of this information was AT&T.
"The AT&T network, on a busy workday, gets around 300 million calls,"
said Rick Greer of AT&T Labs in 2001. Two years later that figure had
grown to 400 million calls and billions of e-mail messages a day. To store
over a trillion records a year, Greer spent much of the last two decades
building Daytona, AT&T's monster in-house database management sys-
tem. Housed at the AT&T Labs Florham Park complex, the same place
that controlled the company's PacketScope cable-tapping operation, the
data warehouse contains an astronomical number of phone records, in-
cluding over 312 terabytes of information and 2.8 trillion records. By
comparison, the 28 million books in the U.S. Library of Congress contain
a total of approximately 20 terabytes of text. Among the databases man-
aged by Daytona was the company's Security Call Analysis and Monitor-
ing Platform (SCAMP), WorldNet IP data warehouse, and Hawkeye, a
gargantuan database containing all of AT&T's phone call records.
  While AT&T uses Hawkeye to store years of compressed, inactive re-
cords, the company keeps the most recent two years' worth of phone data
on SCAMP, which was designed to be accessed frequently. Once a call
has been completed, its details--the phone number called, time of call,
and duration of call--are instantly entered into the SCAMP database. An-
other system, possibly Hawkeye, contains the name and address data. The
NSA obtained direct access to both systems and may have downloaded
massive amounts of the data in order to conduct their own "calling circle"
analysis. "An analyst can query the system for all calls made to a country
from a specific area code during a specific month and get an answer within
a minute," said an AT&T specialist. Thus, the NSA could check all calls
made to Afghanistan from New York City during September 2001, and
have an answer almost instantly. Once the "calling circles" were created,
the NSA began its eavesdropping on the American names and phone num-
bers inside--one, two, or three steps removed from the original target.
   Because of the enormous volume of call records to analyze, NSA is now
outsourcing much of the work to private contractors, a fact that raises seri-
ous additional questions about oversight and concerns over who is given
access to the most private information about Americans. For example,


                                     265

SAIC recently placed an advertisement for a "geo metadata/global network
analyst." The requirements include: "Must be able to manipulate GEO
data, follow and reacquire targets, operationalize analysis, manipulate call
records and conduct call chaining with the purpose of identifying targets."
"Call chaining" is the term used for creating the "calling circles" and the
SAIC office placing the ad was in Columbia, Maryland, near the NSA.
   By 2003, both the NSA and SCAMP were drowning in records. That
year, according to AT&T, SCAMP became "the world's largest publicly
known database by far as verified by being awarded two Grand Prizes
in the 2003 Winter [Corp.] Top 10 Very Large Database contest. Data
management for SCAMP is provided by Daytona." Although AT&T may
have won the top prize for the largest "publicly known database," the
NSA would have likely won the award for the largest database known or
unknown--likely in the mega-petabytes (a petabyte is 1,000 terabytes).
"It's the largest database ever assembled in the world," said one person
about the NSA's phone-record program, adding that it was the agency's
goal "to create a database of every call ever made" within the U.S. "Hav-
ing lots of data gives you lots of power," warned one AT&T official. Even
those involved in the NSA program are becoming "uncomfortable with
the mountain of data they have now begun to accumulate," according to
a lawyer for one.
   This calling-circle program was one of the key reasons that the agency
began bypassing the FISA court and launched its warrantless eavesdrop-
ping program. Unable to show probable cause, or even reasonable suspi-
cion--simply a link to a name or a phone number--the NSA was on an
expansive fishing expedition, an activity strictly prohibited by both FISA
and the Fourth Amendment. People became NSA targets simply because
they happened to call a target, subjecting all of their international com-
munications to warrantless tapping, whether they were simply a neigh-
bor or a friend. The agency termed the activity "hot pursuit" and argued
that it provided "early warning." "The president determined that it was
necessary following September 11 to create an early-warning detection
system," said Assistant Attorney General William E. Moschella. "FISA
could not have provided the speed and agility required for the early-warn-
ing detection system."
   While the NSA focused on the international communications of those
within the calling circles, it also passed on the U.S. phone numbers to


                                         266

                                   M I N E R S

the FBI as unsolicited leads so they could begin a domestic investigation,
including tapping their domestic phone calls. But soon after the program
started, bureau agents began getting swamped with thousands of these
blind names and numbers a month, virtually all of which, according to
some of those involved in the program, led nowhere--to a babysitter or
the local pizza joint. The result was frequent complaints to the bureau's
NSA liaison that the unfiltered and unanalyzed data was flooding them
and keeping them from pursuing more productive work. "We'd chase a
number, find it's a schoolteacher with no indication they've ever been
involved in international terrorism--case closed," said one former FBI
official knowledgeable about the program. "After you get a thousand
numbers and not one is turning up anything, you get some frustration."
   Thus, of the approximately five thousand NSA warrantless taps con-
ducted between September 2001 and December 2005, fewer than ten
Americans a year drew enough suspicion to move to the next level. That
involved obtaining a FISA order to begin targeting their domestic com-
munications. While it could be argued that obtaining those ten was worth
the effort, others would argue that at least that number may have been lost
by flooding the FBI with so much useless information, thus preventing
them from pursuing more promising leads.
   Another problem was the secretive way in which the agency passed
the data to the FBI. At first, because the agents were not cleared for the
program, they were only given the names and phone numbers without any
details as to where they came from or why they might be useful. The NSA
simply told them that it was "information whose source we can't share,
but it indicates that this person has been communicating with a suspected
al-Qaeda operative."
   The program raised serious concerns about issues of privacy. At one
point FBI Director Robert S. Mueller III questioned senior administra-
tion officials about "whether the program had a proper legal foundation."
But the Justice Department, which at about the same time was finding
little problem with torture, told Mueller the department's legal memoran-
dums supported it. Nevertheless, Mueller's concerns were well founded.
Among the places that received data from the NSA's program was the
Defense Intelligence Agency, which, on occasion, used the material to
conduct physical surveillance of people and vehicles within the U.S.
   By 2008, the idea of communications privacy in the United States had


                                     267

                        B O O K T H R E E : C O O P E R A T I O N

literally become a joke. A group calling itself the Billboard Liberation
Front began putting up large billboards bearing the AT&T logo with ad
copy such as: "AT&T works in more places, like NSA HEADQUAR-
TERS." The group said it was offering its help to the phone company for
free to "promote and celebrate the innovative collaboration of these two
global communications giants." According to the group's minister of pro-
paganda, Blank DeCoverly, "These two titans of telecom have a long and
intimate relationship dating back to the age of the telegraph. In these dark
days of terrorism, that should be a comfort to every law-abiding citizen
with nothing to hide."
   Rather than hide its partnership with the NSA, the group suggested
that AT&T should place it at the center of a new ad campaign and even
offered a suggested tagline: "Modern life is so hectic--who has time to
cc the feds on every message? It's a great example of how we anticipate
our customers' needs and act on them."
   But for many, allowing the NSA to plunder everyone's private commu-
nications is not a laughing matter, especially if the agency begins tapping
into such companies as Google. In addition to having millions of e-mail
customers through their Gmail service, the company maintains records of
trillions of Internet searches by hundreds of millions of Americans. For
many, every time they have a question they turn to Google, giving the com-
pany--and thus the NSA--an enormous insight into everyone's thinking.
   According to a former Google executive who left in 2004, the thought
that the NSA's data miners could begin ordering them to install a secret
pipeline to the agency has many in the company worried. "During my
time at Google," he said, "we actually had committee meetings to plan
strategy for what to do if the NSA came to us with a demand--and I
left kind of in the middle of this. We started making process changes to
the way we handled information to make sure that information that the
NSA wanted wouldn't be there. The right thing to do would be to erase
everything, but the founders of Google are such information freaks they
couldn't do that. So they wanted to find ways to make it so that the NSA
couldn't benefit from [the stored data] but Google could. And by the time
I left, they hadn't located that boundary . . . They were really worried
about what would happen if the NSA learned what could be done with in-
formation that Google had. And they figured that they only had a couple
of years before somebody in the government figured it out."

F  or Joe Tomba, it was a homecoming of sorts. Twenty-eight years ear-
   lier he had turned in his security badge and driven away from NSA
headquarters for the last time, never thinking he would ever return. But
now in 2004, both he and the NSA had come full circle. In 1976 the
agency was facing the potential of a major scandal involving warrant-
less eavesdropping on millions of Americans. At the same time, Donald
Rumsfeld at the Pentagon and Dick Cheney at the White House were
urging the president to stonewall any congressional inquiry. At the center
of the controversy, facing a congressional subpoena to testify about the
secret program, was Joe Tomba. But under orders from President Gerald
R. Ford, he refused, and was subsequently cited for contempt of Congress
by a congressional subcommittee.
  By 2004, three years after Mike Hayden launched the NSA's warrant-
less eavesdropping program, the chest-thumping, freewheeling days of
anything-in-the-name-of-security were coming to a close. Fractures were
now beginning to appear in the thick wall of secrecy surrounding the
program and Hayden began to think the unthinkable, that details of the
program would leak and suddenly the agency would be back reliving
the nightmare years of the mid-1970s. Back to the time when the director
was forced to answer hostile questions in front of an angry, open hearing
in Congress and stone-faced FBI agents read the Miranda rights to se-
nior agency officials facing possible arrest and imprisonment. With those
thoughts in mind, the agency began putting together a video to help guide


                                   271

                          B O O K F O U R : D I S C O V E R Y

a new generation of NSA employees through the minefields of congres-
sional inquiries and subpoenas. Thus, the agency invited Joe Tomba to
lend his thoughts to the film: thoughts on what to expect when the wall of
secrecy comes tumbling down around a warrantless eavesdropping pro-
gram.
    Now Tomba was back at Fort Meade, Cheney was back at the White
House, Rumsfeld was back at the Pentagon, and the NSA was back on
the verge of another eavesdropping scandal. As he looked around at the
agency, which had grown into a sprawling city, Tomba's thoughts likely
drifted back three decades, back to that cold day in February when he was
ordered to defy Congress and protect the program and the senior officials
behind it.
   The troubles, as they often do, began with a leak. On July 22, 1975, the
New York Daily News charged that for at least five years the NSA rou-
tinely eavesdropped on commercial cable traffic to and from the United
States. The news shocked many around the country and prompted the
House Government Operations Subcommittee on Government Informa-
tion and Individual Rights to launch an investigation. At the time, few
people in Washington generated as much fear in government circles as
Bella S. Abzug, the subcommittee's hat-wearing chairwoman. To those
occupying the seats of power she was like an ammunition-laden cargo
plane out of control.
    Realizing the difficulty in directly calling NSA officials to testify, Ab-
zug decided to try a different tack. She would instead drag before the
committee, in open session, the executives from the international com-
munications companies who either knew about the massive eavesdrop-
ping operation code-named Operation Shamrock, or had participated in
it. Whereas the NSA might be able to hide behind the shields of classifi-
cations and executive privilege, the same protection was not available to
private corporations.
    But when Don Rumsfeld, the White House chief of staff, first became
aware of the Abzug investigation in late October, he urged President Ford
to launch a major counterattack. As a result, RCA Global and ITT World
Communications, two of the companies that had cooperated with the
agency and had been called to testify, suddenly informed the subcom-
mittee that they would refuse to send officials unless so ordered by a
subpoena. Then on the day before the start of the scheduled hearings,


                                        272

                                F R A C T U R E S

a platoon of officials from the White House, NSA, Pentagon, and Jus-
tice Department converged on the chairwoman in an effort to change her
mind about holding public sessions. In the delegation were NSA direc-
tor Lew Allen, Pentagon intelligence chief Albert Hall, Deputy Attorney
General Harold Tyler, Special Counsel to the President John Marsh, and
White House congressional liaison Charles Leppert. Their argument was
that such hearings would jeopardize either a current Justice Department
criminal investigation or the national security.
   Unimpressed, Abzug refused to cancel or postpone the hearings. So,
in a last-ditch effort, only moments before the congresswoman gaveled
the hearing to order, Attorney General Edward H. Levi personally came
to the hearing room and tried his own appeal. He fared no better than the
others, and at eleven o'clock on October 23, 1975, the hearings began as
scheduled--but without the main witnesses. The only testimony came
from two representatives of AT&T and one of its subsidiaries, Chesa-
peake & Potomac Telephone Company.
   Conceding the first round to the administration, the combative New
York Democrat offered both Allen and Levi a chance to come before the
committee and state their case for the record. Both refused. Thus, on
February 4, 1976, subpoenas were issued to Joe Tomba and executives of
ITT World Communications, RCA Global, and Western Union Interna-
tional. By then, Rumsfeld had become secretary of defense, putting him
in charge of the NSA, and Dick Cheney had become the White House
chief of staff, replacing Rumsfeld. Both believed in maximum executive
power and thus encouraged Ford to flex his presidential muscle and fight
back as hard as possible. Thus, on February 17, in an extraordinary and
unprecedented expansion of the doctrine of executive privilege, Ford in-
structed Rumsfeld and Attorney General Levi to inform Tomba and the
company executives "that they should decline to comply."
   The following day Rumsfeld instructed Tomba that, inasmuch as Pres-
ident Ford has asserted executive privilege in the matter, the subpoenas
were not to be complied with. Then, for the first time in history, the con-
cept of executive privilege was extended to a private corporation: At-
torney General Levi, in a letter to the attorney for Western Union, wrote,
"On behalf of the President, I hereby request that Western Union Interna-
tional honor this invocation of executive privilege."
  With the stage set for a major battle between the Congress and the


                                      273

                          B O O K F O U R : D I S C O V E R Y

executive branch, on February 25 the Manhattan congresswoman once
again called the hearings to order and the subcommittee turned its atten-
tion to Joseph J. Tomba, a dark-haired, middle-level NSA employee in his
mid-thirties. An engineer with sixteen years of service at the NSA, he had
been recruited during his senior year at West Virginia University in 1960.
Assigned in the mid-1960s to the C1 Group in PROD, the NSA's opera-
tions division, he eventually was promoted to a supervisory position. In
1970 he apparently took over management of Operation Shamrock from
a Mr. Feeney, who had held the position for eighteen years, from the time
the NSA was created in 1952. So compartmented was the program that
besides the middle-level manager, the only other persons exercising re-
sponsibility over the operation were the director and deputy director.
   Under orders from Rumsfeld and the president, Tomba sought refuge
behind executive privilege, but not before he drew the ire of the subcom-
mittee with a brief opening statement. "General Allen has asked me to
convey to you," he told a surprised Abzug, "his willingness to attempt
to meet the requirements of your subcommittee along with the neces-
sary safeguards applicable to any classified information. To this end, his
staff is available to work with your people to define more precisely your
exact information requirements." "I certainly appreciate your bringing
that message to us personally," the chairwoman responded after stating
that the subcommittee already had invited the general on several occa-
sions, "particularly since it is quite obvious that apparently no telephone
communication can be made without interception." A few minutes later,
by a vote of 6 to 1, the subcommittee voted to recommend to the full
committee that Tomba and the other witnesses be cited for contempt of
Congress.
   Stonewalled by the government, the subcommittee next turned to the
telegraph companies. On March 3, Thomas S. Greenish, executive vice
president of Western Union International, testified before the panel and
turned over an eight-year-old list of NSA targets, an action that Ford,
Cheney, and Rumsfeld had vigorously attempted to block by asking the
corporation to honor Ford's all-embracing claim of executive privilege.
   Following Greenish to the witness table was Howard R. Hawkins,
chairman of the board and chief executive officer of RCA Global Com-
munications, along with several of his subordinates. Their testimony rep-
resented still another defeat for the administration. Attorney General Levi


                                        274

                                 F R A C T U R E S

had earlier asked, "on behalf of the President," that representatives of the
corporation neither testify before the subcommittee nor produce docu-
ments, "until procedures can be agreed upon to assure that the president's
invocation of executive privilege is not effectively undone." Apparently
fearing the stormy congresswoman more than the president and attor-
ney general, Hawkins and his associates went ahead with their testimony
and also produced an assortment of records. About a week later, George
Knapp, president of ITT World Communications, and several other em-
ployees also testified about Shamrock. By then the administration seemed
to have thrown in the towel; it made no attempt to prevent their appear-
ance.
   After the hearings, the subcommittee staff began work on a draft re-
port, to be issued by the Government Operations Committee, that exam-
ined the NSA's eavesdropping activities on communications entering and
leaving the country. But a controversy soon arose over whether the report
should be released, and, following its completion in the fall of 1977, the
decision was made to quietly kill it. Titled "Interception of International
Telecommunications by the National Security Agency," the draft of the
report pointed to the NSA's "extraordinary capability to intercept" and
concluded that "no other agency of the federal government undertakes
such activity on such an immense scale." Calling the enormous secrecy
surrounding the agency "obsessive and unfounded," the report went on
to charge that the NSA's appeal to the Congress and the public that they
simply "trust us" was totally unjustified when viewed in light of the agen-
cy's long record of privacy violations.
   The report was particularly critical of the agency's constant attempts
to hide behind semantics. Pointing to a statement by Vice Admiral Bobby
Inman, General Allen's successor as NSA director, in which he stated:
"Let there be no doubt . . . there are no U.S. citizens now targeted by the
NSA in the United States or abroad, none," the report called the declara-
tion "misleading." It added that "while an American citizen or company
might not be targeted by name, by virtue of his international activities, his
communications might be selected by the NSA on the basis of its `foreign
intelligence' criteria. The NSA has not denied that it, in fact, `selects'
U.S. messages of this nature."
   Although spared the final indignity of a public report on Shamrock by
the Abzug subcommittee, the NSA was not yet out of the fire. The Rock-


                                       275

                           B O O K F O U R : D I S C O V E R Y

efeller Commission, ironically set up by the White House under Vice
President Nelson A. Rockefeller to counter the congressional investiga-
tions, came up with its own allegations of questionable activities on the
part of the NSA.
  As a result, Attorney General Levi established a top-secret task force
made up of Justice Department prosecutors and FBI agents to investigate
the commission's findings. It was the first time that any law enforcement
agency had ever been charged with investigating the legality of the NSA's
operations, and the reaction within the agency was predictably hostile.
Noting that "attitudes ranged from circumspection to wariness," Dougald
D. McMillan, author of the task force's final report, wrote that "one typi-
cally had to ask the right question to elicit the right answer or document."
He pointed out that "it is likely, therefore, that we had insufficient infor-
mation on occasion to frame the `magic' question. One also had to as-
certain the specific person or division to whom the right question should
be addressed, since compartmentalization of intelligence-gathering often
results in one hand not knowing what the other is doing."
   Nevertheless, over the course of twelve months, the handpicked, spe-
cially cleared team of lawyers and agents gradually pulled back layer
after layer of secrecy cloaking some of the NSA's most advanced eaves-
dropping technology and supersecret processing techniques. The final
report of the task force, classified Top Secret Umbra/Handle via Comint
Channels Only, and excluded from declassification, was considered so
sensitive that only two copies were ever printed. In the end, despite the
fact that the task force had managed to uncover numerous examples of
potentially illegal eavesdropping activities, the report concluded with
the recommendation that the inquiry be terminated. "There is likely to
be much `buck-passing' from subordinate to superior, agency to agency,
agency to board or committee, board or committee to the President, and
from the living to the dead."
   In addition, calling the subject matter of the report "an international
cause célèbre involving fundamental constitutional rights of United
States citizens," the task force pointed to the likelihood of "graymail" and
the possibility that defense attorneys would probably subpoena "every
tenuously involved government official and former official" to establish
that authority for the various operations emanated from on high. "While
the high office of prospective defense witnesses should not enter into the


                                         276

                                  F R A C T U R E S

prosecutive decision," the report noted, "the confusion, obfuscation, and
surprise testimony which might result cannot be ignored." Rather than
point a finger at any one official or any one agency, the task force instead
indicted the national security system as a whole, a system that granted
the agencies "too much discretionary authority with too little account-
ability . . . a 35-year failing of Presidents and the Congress rather than
the agencies."
    While on the one hand charging that those NSA and cable company
employees who participated in Shamrock apparently violated several
sections of the Communications Act of 1934, the "Prosecutive Summary"
pointed to the NSA's highly secret executive branch "charter," National
Security Council Intelligence Directive (NSCID) No. 9 (later NSCID
No. 6), which gave the agency virtual carte blanche to disregard legal
restraints placed on the rest of the government. "Orders, directives, poli-
cies, or recommendations of any authority of the Executive branch relat-
ing to the collection . . . of intelligence," the top-secret document reads,
". . . shall not be applicable to [the NSA's] Communications Intelligence
activities, unless specifically so stated." The summary concluded: "Its
birth certificate [which was, by the way, top secret] said it did not have to
follow the limitations in the NSES [National Security Electronic Surveil-
lance] area that limited other agencies unless it was expressly directed to
do so."
    Another reason for recommending against prosecution with regard to
Shamrock was far less complex: "It is not illegal to `ask' a company to
give out copies of cables. If the company complies, it may be violating
the statute but the recipient would not."
    Mike Hayden knew the history of Shamrock as if it were tattooed on
his eyelids. And he knew that once a scandal flared, it could quickly turn
into a firestorm and level everything in its path. It was largely because of
Shamrock that FISA and the FISA court were created in the first place.
And it was one of the reasons that Congress put sharp teeth in the law,
making violation a felony punishable by five years in prison for every
count--every warrantless intercept.
    In March 2004, a nervous Mike Hayden began seeing the first sign of
fractures in the wall of secrecy protecting his own Shamrock, his warrant-
less eavesdropping program.

S   tretched along Washington's Pennsylvania Avenue, the Justice De-
    partment has the appearance of a place that can hold a secret. Its
doors are two stories tall and made of high-strength aluminum, and its
walls are Indiana limestone over a steel frame. By 2004, the building
was holding a great many secrets, the most sensitive of which was the
presidential authorization directing the NSA to bypass the FISA court
and launch a wide-ranging list of warrantless eavesdropping and data
mining programs. So great was the secret that even James Comey, the
deputy attorney general and the number two law enforcement official in
the country, was not cleared for the program until late in his tenure.
  Tall and lanky with a touch of Jimmy Stewart, Comey, the forty-five-
year-old grandson of an Irish cop, had come a long way. But in the Bush
administration, access to the innermost secrets was a decision based less
on loyalty to the law than loyalty to the lawyer, specifically David Add-
ington, the counsel to Dick Cheney (later his chief of staff). Then forty-
seven, Addington had worked for Cheney much of his adult life, and
both shared a common belief that over the past few decades the power
of the president had been reduced to that of a petty bureaucrat. Their
goal was to restore both power and grandeur to the office, and scuttling
the FISA court, with its nitpicky judges, was one step down that road.
"We're going to push and push and push until some larger force makes us
stop," he once said. Comey, a straight-arrow government worker without
a political agenda, did not fit into Addington's world. As long as Attorney

General John Ashcroft could rubber-stamp the program's renewal every
forty-five days, there would be no need to brief him. Nor had his prede-
cessor, Larry Thompson, ever been cleared for the program. It was only at
the insistence of Jack Goldsmith, the assistant attorney general in charge
of the Office of Legal Counsel, that Comey was read in on it. "There was
a little bit of a struggle getting Mr. Comey read into the program," said
Goldsmith.
   Forty-one-year-old Jack Goldsmith, stocky and rumpled like a dod-
dering uncle, had solid conservative credentials. But his loyalty, like that
of his boss Comey, was to the statue of Lady Justice in the building's
Great Hall, not to Addington and Cheney. Nor did he share their fever
for turning the presidency into a monarchy. Instead, he helped lead a
small coterie of lawyers who were repelled by the Bush administration's
use of bureaucratic strong-arm tactics to bend, twist, and break the laws
they had little use for, such as FISA. And Goldsmith also did not buy
into the legal somersaults required to justify the warrantless surveillance
program the Bush administration later tagged the Terrorist Surveillance
Program (TSP).
   Calling Addington "the chief legal architect of the Terrorist Surveil-
lance Program," Goldsmith added, "he and the vice president had abhorred
FISA's intrusion on presidential power ever since its enactment in 1978."
Addington and Cheney had originally wanted John Yoo, the architect of
the legal justification for the NSA's warrantless program, to be promoted
to head the office, but Ashcroft thought Cheney was already interfering
too much in his department and that was never going to happen.
   Since he first arrived in October 2003, Goldsmith had been reviewing
the administration's warrantless eavesdropping program, and he didn't
like what he saw. "It was the biggest legal mess I've ever encountered,"
he said, and submitted his view to Ashcroft in a top-secret draft mem-
orandum titled "Review of Legality of the [NSA] Program." By early
March 2004, both he and Comey concluded the Justice Department could
no longer certify the program as legal. "There were certain aspects of
programs related to the TSP that I could not find a legal support for," said
Goldsmith.
  As a result, a decision had to be made--and made quickly--as to
whether to recommend that Ashcroft refuse to recertify it. "The program
had to be renewed by March the 11th--which was a Thursday--of 2004,"


                                       279

                          B O O K F O U R : D I S C O V E R Y

said Comey. "And we were engaged in a very intensive reevaluation of
the matter." About a week before, on Thursday, March 4, Comey met
with Ashcroft for an hour to pass on his and Goldsmith's analysis of the
NSA's warrantless programs. "We had concerns as to our ability to certify
[their] legality," said Comey. Ashcroft agreed and decided he was not go-
ing to sign the recertification form the next day. It was a program he had
never liked from the beginning but felt he was ordered to go along with.
The White House had "just shoved it in front of me and told me to sign it,"
he told several associates.
   A few hours later Ashcroft was in his office preparing to announce the
convictions of three defendants linked to an alleged "Virginia jihad net-
work." Suddenly he began experiencing increasing pain in his stomach.
A call was made to White House physician Daniel Parks, who examined
Ashcroft and advised him to go to the hospital. At George Washington
University Hospital, he was admitted to a special four-room "pod" in the
intensive care section that was cordoned off and designed to protect VIP
patients. Following an examination, doctors determined that the attorney
general had a severe case of gallstone pancreatitis, an inflammation of a
digestive organ that can be very painful. Back at the Justice Department,
Comey became the acting attorney general.
   By Monday doctors had decided that, as a precautionary measure, they
needed to remove Ashcroft's gallbladder to prevent a recurrence of the
painful gallstones, and on Tuesday, March 9, Dr. Bruce Abell began the
operation, inserting a narrow instrument into the attorney general's ab-
domen through the navel and extracting the gallbladder. It was a major
procedure lasting about an hour and a half that left Ashcroft weak and in
guarded condition.
   At noon, shortly after Ashcroft was wheeled into his intensive care
suite, Comey was at the White House taking his seat in the West Wing
office of Andy Card, the president's chief of staff. At fifty-six, Card knew
George W. Bush almost as well as a brother. He was seated with Bush's
father, the former president, when he vomited on the Japanese prime min-
ister; he was standing next to father and son as they shed tears in the Oval
Office on Inauguration Day 2001; and he was the one who whispered in
George W.'s ear on 9/11 that the country was under attack. Now his job
was to keep the president's warrantless eavesdropping program going de-
spite the warning signals from Comey.

   So secret was the program that a good percentage of those officials
cleared for it were also present in the room, including Cheney, Adding-
ton, Hayden, FBI Director Robert Mueller, CIA Deputy Director John
McLaughlin, and White House Counsel Alberto Gonzales. The news
was not good. Comey told the group that the department had determined
the NSA program had no legal basis and he would not renew it. "As act-
ing attorney general," he said, "I would not certify the program as to its
legality."
   Without Comey's signature, the NSA would have to immediately
pull the plug on the operation or possibly face criminal charges. Worse,
Cheney and Card suddenly realized that their tightly controlled White
House now had a loose cannon atop the Justice Department. Four hours
later, Comey was back in Card's office with Cheney, Hayden, Addington,
and the others, but this time he brought with him his top legal experts
from Goldsmith's office to explain in detail why the NSA program was
not legal.
   On Wednesday morning the Washington Post ran an article about the
attorney general indicating that he was having a rough time. "Ashcroft in
Guarded Condition After Surgery," said the headline on page two. And at
the Justice Department there appeared to be an odd calm, with no com-
munication from the White House concerning the program's renewal,
which was scheduled for the following day.
   Far from calm, there was near panic at the White House as Card and
Gonzales feared that a shutdown of the NSA program was only hours
away. Pulling out all the stops, late in the afternoon they called an emer-
gency meeting in the Situation Room with the "Gang of Eight." That
included the top Democrat and Republican in both the Senate and House,
and in the Senate and House intelligence committees. "We informed the
leadership that Mr. Comey felt the president did not have the authority
to authorize these activities," said Gonzales, "and we were there ask-
ing for help, to ask for emergency legislation." According to Gonzales,
"the consensus in the room from the congressional leadership is that we
should continue the activities, at least for now, despite the objections of
Mr. Comey. There was also consensus that it would be very, very diffi-
cult to obtain legislation without compromising this program, but that we
should look for a way ahead."
   But West Virginia senator Jay Rockefeller, the ranking Democrat on


                                      281

                          B O O K F O U R : D I S C O V E R Y

the Senate Intelligence Committee, later all but accused Gonzales of ly-
ing. Rockefeller, who was at the meeting, insisted he had "never heard of"
Comey at the time and that they were never told of any infighting at the
Justice Department over intelligence programs. He also denied that they
were asked to enact legislation to overcome Comey's resistance. "They
were not telling us what was really going on," Rockefeller said. Another
person at the meeting who disagreed with Gonzales's assessment was the
California Democrat Nancy Pelosi, then the House minority leader and
later speaker. "I made clear my disagreement with what the White House
was asking," she said.
   Gonzales and Card had one last desperate option. Race to the hospital,
tell Ashcroft about the congressional support, and get him to reclaim his
authority as attorney general and then recertify the program. But first they
would have to call him up to ask him to see them. And that call would
have to come from Bush himself.
   By 7:00 p.m. it was dark, and Comey decided to head for home. He
climbed into his black Justice Department SUV, which was driven by an
FBI agent and trailed by a follow-up car. Soon after the car turned onto
Constitution Avenue, however, his cell phone rang. On the other end was
David Ayers, Ashcroft's chief of staff. "He had gotten a call from Mrs.
[Janet] Ashcroft from the hospital," recalled Comey. "She had banned all
visitors and all phone calls. So I hadn't seen him or talked to him because
he was very ill. And Mrs. Ashcroft reported that a call had come through,
and that as a result of that call Mr. Card and Mr. Gonzales were on their
way to the hospital to see Mr. Ashcroft." Comey added, "I have some
recollection that the call was from the president himself."
   Now Comey understood the calm. Rather than wait until Thursday
and have the NSA program declared legally unsupportable and scrapped,
the president and his men had decided to make an end run around him
the night before. "I was concerned that, given how ill I knew the attor-
ney general was, that there might be an effort to ask him to overrule me
when he was in no condition to do that," said Comey. "So I hung up the
phone, immediately called my chief of staff, told him to get as many of
my people as possible to the hospital immediately. I hung up, called [FBI]
Director Mueller." At 7:20, Mueller received the call while having dinner
in a restaurant with his wife and daughter. "I'll meet you at the hospital
right now," Mueller responded. Comey then turned to his security detail.


                                        282

                                 E M E R G E N C Y

"I need to get to George Washington Hospital immediately," he told them
as they turned on the car's emergency equipment.
   With the siren wailing and red and blue lights flashing from the roof
and grille of the car, Comey was at the hospital within just a few minutes.
"I got out of the car and ran up--literally ran up the stairs with my security
detail," he said. "And so I raced to the hospital room, entered. And Mrs.
Ashcroft was standing by the hospital bed, Mr. Ashcroft was lying down
in the bed, the room was darkened. And I immediately began speaking to
him, trying to orient him as to time and place, and trying to see if he could
focus on what was happening, and it wasn't clear to me that he could. He
seemed pretty bad off."
   The White House was just blocks away and Comey knew that the pres-
ident's men could arrive any minute. He needed some muscle to keep
from being removed from the room when they arrived. "Director Mueller
instructed the FBI agents present not to allow me to be removed from
the room under any circumstances," said Comey, who took a seat in an
armchair by the head of the bed with his two aides standing behind him. It
was a short wait. A few minutes later, Gonzales and Card stormed in.
   "How are you, General?" Gonzales asked, the envelope containing the
unsigned NSA recertification in his hand. "Not well," Ashcroft replied,
flatly refusing to sign the document. "But that doesn't matter, because
I'm not the attorney general. There is the attorney general," he said, point-
ing at Comey. Their ambush foiled, Comey could feel the room turn to
ice. "The two men did not acknowledge me," he said. "Be well," Card
said to Ashcroft as the two turned and walked from the room.
   A few minutes later, at 7:40, FBI director Mueller arrived at the inten-
sive care suite and Comey filled him in on what had taken place. Mueller
then went into Ashcroft's room and saw him sitting in a chair. "Fee-
ble, barely articulate, clearly stressed," he noted. To Mueller's surprise,
Ashcroft complained that even he, the attorney general, was never able to
get the full details of the NSA program from the White House. Mueller
would later note, "The AG also told them [Card and Gonzales] that he
was barred from obtaining the advice he needed on the program by the
strict compartmentalization rules of the WH [White House]." As Mueller
was in with Ashcroft, an FBI agent notified Comey that he had an urgent
call in the command center that had been set up next to Ashcroft's room.
   "I took the call," said Comey. "And Mr. Card was very upset and de-


                                       283

                           B O O K F O U R : D I S C O V E R Y

manded that I come to the White House immediately." But in an unprece-
dented act of distrust at the highest levels of government, the nation's top
law enforcement official refused to meet alone with the president's chief
of staff in the White House. "I responded that, after the conduct I had
just witnessed, I would not meet with him without a witness present . . . I
was concerned that this was an effort to do an end run around the acting
attorney general and to get a very sick man to approve something that
the Department of Justice had already concluded--the department as a
whole--was unable to be certified as to its legality."
   Comey was boiling. "After what I just witnessed," he told Card, "I
will not meet with you without a witness. And I intend that witness to
be the solicitor general of the United States." At the time, the solicitor
general was Ted Olson, whose wife, Barbara Olson, died on 9/11 when
her American Airlines jet smashed into the Pentagon. "Until I can con-
nect with Mr. Olson, I'm not going to meet with you." Card asked Comey
if he was refusing to come to the White House, a fireable offense. "No,
sir, I'm not. I'll be there. I need to go back to the Department of Justice
first," said Comey.
   At about 11:00, the FBI security detail drove Comey and Olson to the
White House. "We went into the West Wing," said Comey. "Mr. Card was
concerned . . . he had heard reports that there were to be a large number
of resignations at the Department of Justice." Comey reiterated his belief
that the NSA program was outside the law and said he would not sign
the certification. With the issue still unresolved, the group departed the
White House as the clock neared midnight and the deadline for approval
arrived.
   On Thursday, Bush decided to reauthorize the NSA program in spite
of the view by his own Justice Department that it was not legal. It had not
been legal from the start, but Bush and Hayden had at least taken comfort
from the fact that the attorney general would put his stamp of approval on
it every forty-five days. Now they didn't even have that. Worse, they were
on notice that they were breaking the law.
   At the Justice Department, it was the final straw for Comey. "The pro-
gram was reauthorized without us and without a signature from the De-
partment of Justice attesting as to its legality," he said. "And I prepared a
letter of resignation, intending to resign the next day, Friday, March the
12th . . . I didn't believe that as the chief law enforcement officer in the


                                         284

                                E M E R G E N C Y

country I could stay when they had gone ahead and done something that
I had said I could find no legal basis for . . . It was going forward even
though I had communicated, `I cannot approve this as to its legality.' "
   Not only was Comey planning to resign, so were Mueller, Goldsmith,
and a slew of other Justice Department officials, including the attorney
general himself. "Mr. Ashcroft's chief of staff asked me something that
meant a great deal to him," said Comey. "And that is that I not resign until
Mr. Ashcroft was well enough to resign with me. He was very concerned
that Mr. Ashcroft was not well enough to understand fully what was go-
ing on. And he begged me to wait until--this was Thursday that I was
making this decision--to wait until Monday to give him the weekend to
get oriented enough so that I wouldn't leave him behind, was his concern."
Both Comey and Ashcroft's chief of staff were convinced the attorney
general would join in the mutiny. "Friday would be my last day and Mon-
day morning I would resign," said Comey.
   Never in history had so many senior government officials threatened
to resign to protest an administration's disregard for the law. That the top
leadership of the Justice Department and the FBI had agreed to a mass
resignation, led by the attorney general, indicates the seriousness with
which they viewed the misconduct of both the Bush White House and
Hayden's NSA.
   Bush knew what happened following the "Saturday Night Massacre"
at Justice during Nixon's Watergate years, when top officials quit rather
than fire the special prosecutor, and he had no stomach to fight an almost
certain call for his impeachment. In addition, it was an election year and
in a few months he would be fighting John Kerry to remain in the White
House, and a messy scandal at the Justice Department would be just what
the Democrats would like.
   On Friday morning, Comey, together with Mueller, went to the Oval
Office to brief Bush and Cheney on counterterrorism issues. But after the
short session, this time there was something different. "As I was leaving,
the president asked to speak to me, took me in his study, and we had a one-
on-one meeting,"said Comey. During their meeting, Comey told Bush
what changes the NSA would have to make in order to bring the program
back within the law--changes Cheney still opposed. At the end of the
session, Bush was still noncommittal but agreed to talk to Mueller, who
was waiting for Comey in the White House lobby. "I'll talk to Director


                                      285

                         B O O K F O U R : D I S C O V E R Y

Mueller," said Bush. At 9:45, Mueller gave the president a similar ap-
praisal of the NSA program's lack of legal standing and Bush, overruling
Cheney, finally agreed to implement the changes.
  The changes involved scrapping several of the NSA's most illegal data
mining operations, reworking others, and more fully justifying the pro-
gram not just under the president's Article 2 inherent authority argument,
but also under an even less valid argument. This was the congressional
authorization to use force against al-Qaeda--which few even in Congress
believe granted authority for eavesdropping on Americans. But according
to Comey, it would be three weeks or so before the Justice Department
was able to recertify the program--three weeks in which the NSA and
the White House were operating a surveillance system without legal au-
thorization.
   Despite the changes, the NSA's warrantless program continued to be
operated outside the law. While a few of the most egregious aspects had
been eliminated or modified, it was still in violation of FISA, which re-
quired all national security eavesdropping to be approved by the FISA
court--under penalty of imprisonment and with no exceptions. But be-
cause of the Bush administration's trademark go-it-alone policy, the pro-
gram would continue in violation of FISA. And Hayden's wall of secrecy
surrounding it would remain intact. But not for long.

                              Exposure



I n the late summer of 2004, Hayden received a call from James Risen,
  forty-eight, a reporter at the New York Times, about an NSA program to
eavesdrop on Americans without a warrant. Hayden was stunned. With-
out confirming anything, he said that whatever the NSA might be doing
was "intensely operational" and, he added quickly, "legal, appropriate,
and effective." He then quickly ended the conversation.
   As Hayden hung up the phone he could see his foot-thick wall of se-
crecy finally crumbling around him. It was time to start preparing his
employees for possible hearings and investigations. Time to explain the
dos, don'ts, and dodges to those potentially facing subpoenas; time to
recall Joe Tomba to NSA to help explain what to expect and what not to
expect when staring up at a half circle of angry members of Congress.
Some NSA officials even began seeking out defense lawyers.
   The phone call touched off a quiet, escalating, and long-running game
of cat and mouse in which the NSA and later the White House alter-
nated between threats and pleas to convince the Times to scrap the story.
In the beginning, the officials would only discuss the eavesdropping in
hypotheticals, telling the Times that "if" such a program existed, "dis-
closure would do serious and perhaps irreparable harm to national secu-
rity." Eventually the hypotheticals were dropped and replaced by actual
details.
   After sitting on the story for more than a year, the Times again got in
touch with the NSA in the fall of 2005, and Hayden and the Bush admin-


                                    287

                          B O O K F O U R : D I S C O V E R Y

istration once again went to battle stations, inviting Times editors and
reporters to a power session at the White House. There to greet them was
Hayden; newly appointed Secretary of State Condi Rice; National Secu-
rity Advisor Stephen Hadley; John Negroponte, the director of national
intelligence; and Harriet Miers, the White House counsel. Cheney, along
with Hayden the architect of the plan, had considered attending but wisely,
given his reputation within the press, decided to sit out the session.
   At the meeting, the Times's executive editor, Bill Keller, was warned
that publication of the story would alert the terrorists and "shut down the
game." "It's all the marbles," said one official cryptically, adding, "The
enemy is inside the gates." For Hayden, among his most serious concerns
was not releasing the fact that most international communications pass
through U.S. switches, making them vulnerable to NSA's eavesdropping.
In sum, the consensus was that if there was another 9/11, the Times would
share in the blame. But by the time the meeting ended, the White House
realized that they had reached a dead end.
   Within hours, however, officials were requesting one final summit--a
showdown of sorts between President George W. Bush and Times pub-
lisher Arthur Sulzberger Jr. A few days later in the Oval Office, on Mon-
day, December 5, Hayden, carrying a heavy black briefing book, took a
seat near the fireplace a few feet from the president. Looking at Sulz-
berger, Bush said that if the paper went ahead with publication and an-
other attack took place, they would be sitting alongside each other in a
congressional hearing room explaining why it happened and how they
missed it. Bush then added, "There'll be blood on your hands."
   But in the end, Keller and Sulzberger agreed that they had heard noth-
ing new to make them change their minds. The White House asked for
more meetings but the decision was to publish immediately. Thus, on
Friday, December 16, the Times rolled out its story.
   The next day Bush discussed the NSA program in his Saturday radio
address. "In the weeks following the terrorist attacks on our nation," he
said, "I authorized the National Security Agency, consistent with U.S.
law and the Constitution, to intercept the international communications
of people with known links to al-Qaeda and related terrorist organiza-
tions. Before we intercept these communications, the government must
have information that establishes a clear link to these terrorist networks."
   He also said, "The activities I authorized are reviewed approximately


                                        288

                                  E X P O S U R E

every forty-five days. Each review is based on a fresh intelligence assess-
ment of terrorist threats to the continuity of our government and the threat
of catastrophic damage to our homeland. During each assessment, previ-
ous activities under the authorization are reviewed. The review includes
approval by our nation's top legal officials, including the attorney general
and the counsel to the president. I have reauthorized this program more
than thirty times since the September the 11th attacks, and I intend to do
so for as long as our nation faces a continuing threat from al-Qaeda and
related groups."
   The following month, concerned about Congress, the press, and the
public using the terms "warrantless wiretapping" and "warrantless sur-
veillance" to refer to the program, Bush attempted to rebrand it. His
new name was the "Terrorist Surveillance Program (TSP)," something it
had never been called before. Later, Attorney General Alberto Gonzales
would obliquely make a distinction. He would indicate that the TSP--
mostly voice and data eavesdropping activities--was the program that
began around April 2004, following reforms after the infamous Ashcroft
hospital visit. The NSA program that was in existence from October 2001
until then--largely highly questionable data mining activities--he would
simply call "other intelligence activities."
   At the NSA there was shock and outrage by many employees who be-
lieved that the NSA had long ago learned from its past mistakes and put
an end to warrantless eavesdropping on Americans and looking for ways
to evade the law. Many believed Hayden had squandered thirty years of
hard work to restore the NSA to a place where it could be trusted again
by the American public. Some even protested to the agency's inspector
general, asking for an internal investigation, a serious indication of how
far the agency's star had fallen even within its own secret city.
  "Until the story broke in the New York Times," Hayden said, "no one
who was asked to be part of this program inside the National Security
Agency expressed any reservations about being part of this program. Af-
ter the story broke, people who were not part of the program were quite
understandably concerned about what might be going on; they then went
to the NSA IG to ask questions about it." At a time when the NSA needed
a Jim Comey or a Bob Mueller, it had only a three-star sycophant un-
willing to protect the agency from the destructive forces of Cheney and
Addington.

   Within days of the report, the once solid and airtight FISA court be-
gan developing cracks. U.S. District Judge James Robertson, one of the
eleven Top Secret­cleared members of the panel, sent a letter to Chief
Justice John G. Roberts Jr. notifying him that he was quitting the court.
Though he gave no explanation, two of his colleagues who were familiar
with his decision said that Robertson was deeply troubled by the war-
rantless surveillance, which he found legally questionable. He was also
concerned that the program may have compromised the work of the court
by using information from illegally obtained taps in applications for FISA
orders. "They just don't know if the product of wiretaps were used for
FISA warrants--to kind of cleanse the information," said one person fa-
miliar with the court. "What I've heard some of the judges say is they feel
they've participated in a Potemkin court."
   In August 2006, the NSA and the Bush administration began looking
ahead with considerable concern. That month a judge ruled in the first
lawsuit brought against the NSA over the warrantless surveillance pro-
gram, launched by the American Civil Liberties Union shortly after the
New York Times article. The organization asked the federal courts to rule
that the program was illegal and to bring it to an end. Among the plain-
tiffs were individuals and groups across the political spectrum, including
scholars, lawyers, and journalists (including the author).
   On August 17, 2006, U.S. District Court Judge Anna Diggs Taylor,
seventy-three, rejected almost every argument from the Bush administra-
tion, including the "inherent powers" of the president, and the "authori-
zation to use military force against al-Qaeda" arguments, and found in
favor of the ACLU. Ruling that the NSA program was illegal, violating
both FISA and the Fourth Amendment of the Constitution, she ordered
it shut down. "It was never the intent of the framers to give the president
such unfettered control, particularly when his actions blatantly disregard
the parameters clearly enumerated in the Bill of Rights," she wrote. "The
three separate branches of government were developed as a check and
balance for one another." Rejecting the idea that the president can eaves-
drop on Americans simply as a result of his "inherent powers," Judge
Taylor ruled, "There are no hereditary Kings in America and no powers
not created by the Constitution. So all `inherent powers' must derive from
that Constitution." Upon hearing the decision, Attorney General Alberto
Gonzales called an impromptu news conference. "As you know, today, a


                                       290

                                 E X P O S U R E

district court judge in Michigan ruled that the program was unlawful," he
said. "We disagree with the decision."
   Shaken by the court's decision, the NSA immediately asked Judge
Taylor to stay the ruling so the program could continue until a decision by
an appeals court, which was granted. But the agency faced another major
blow in November when the congressional elections gave both houses to
the Democrats--representatives and senators who were champing at the
bit to begin holding hearings in January on such Bush administration pro-
grams as the NSA's warrantless eavesdropping operation. Also in January
was the federal appeals court hearing in which the Bush administration
was going to try to convince a panel of three judges to overturn Judge
Taylor's ruling. An unfavorable ruling by the appeals court, and the only
salvation would be a positive ruling by the U.S. Supreme Court.
   Given the many storm clouds on the horizon, and growing pressure
from the telecoms who were being sued by angry customers and public
interest groups, the NSA and the Justice Department began looking for
a way out. Eventually, on January 10, 2007, they got one of the eleven
judges on the FISA court, who rotate in and out of Washington, to inter-
pret as permissible a key aspect of the warrantless program. This involved
working with a friendly judge to come up with an "innovative" way to in-
terpret the FISA statute so that the agency could target foreign-to-foreign
communications that simply transit a U.S. switch--and the interception
is done on U.S. soil--without going to the court for every name.
   Under the traditional interpretation of FISA, the NSA would need to
get a warrant from the FISA court before targeting the transit communi-
cation of either foreign individual as long as it enters the U.S. on a wire,
such as an undersea fiber-optic cable, and also as long as it is intercepted
inside the U.S.--for example, at the switch or at a listening post such
as NSA Georgia. The new "innovative" approach may involve a rein-
terpretation of the law to include a "programmatic" or blanket approach.
Thus the NSA would program into its intercept equipment the names and
phone numbers of foreigners whom they have probable cause to believe
are members of al-Qaeda or an associate terrorist organization. Under the
new interpretation, the NSA may not need to submit an application for
these foreign-to-foreign communications, except when one end reaches a
U.S. phone. In that case the agency can begin eavesdropping immediately
as long as an emergency application is made within three days.

   Once the procedures were worked out, the agency only needed to wait
until the friendly judge began his or her rotation onto the court--which
took place on January 17. Then the judge simply issued the prearranged
order and the NSA was in business. "We got a favorable ruling from the
court, and in essence, we could conduct our mission," said Mike McCon-
nell.
   There was thus no longer any need to operate outside the FISA court.
Finally, on January 17, Attorney General Gonzales announced that the
warrantless eavesdropping program was coming to an end and the NSA's
eavesdropping activities from then on would once again come under the
FISA court. "All surveillance previously occurring under the Terrorist
Surveillance Program (TSP) would now be conducted subject to the
approval of the FISC," Gonzales said. "Under these circumstances, the
President had determined not to reauthorize the TSP when the then cur-
rent authorization expired."
   The only problem with the NSA's approach was that the program had
to be renewed every few months and that other, less friendly judges might
not come to the same interpretation--which is what happened just a few
months later. "The second judge looked at the same data and said, `Well,
wait a minute. I interpret the law, which is the FISA law, differently,' "
recalled McConnell. "And it came down to, if it's on a wire and it's for-
eign in a foreign country, you have to have a warrant." Suddenly the NSA
was back to the pre-9/11 days--at the same time it was racing to find
American soldiers kidnapped in Iraq. And their kidnappers' Iraq-to-Iraq
communications were transiting the U.S.--on a wire.

N   ineteen-year-old Steven D. Green sat in a Midland, Texas, recruiter's
    office with a photo of George W. Bush smiling down from the wall.
Like the president, Green was a native son of the West Texas oil town,
where his schoolmates nicknamed him "the drifter." By January 2005, the
once-proud U.S. Army had been reduced to emptying jail cells and drunk
tanks to fill its quota of Iraq-bound soldiers. Criminals, dropouts, and
the unemployable were now sought after, given bonuses, outfitted with
deadly weapons, and then set loose in a crowded land with few rules, less
oversight, and a license to kill.
   A few days before, Green, a bony-faced, unemployed tenth-grade
dropout, had been behind bars in a grimy lockup on alcohol-possession
charges, his third time under arrest. He was troubled from an early age,
one neighbor said. "I don't know if he killed small cats or anything, but
that's the kind of kid he was." Nevertheless, like 11,017 others in 2005,
many with felony convictions, Green was granted a "moral waiver" by
the army and was soon wearing the American flag on his shoulder as he
kicked in doors in Baghdad and aimed his M-249 belt-fed machine gun
at petrified women and children.
  "I came over here because I wanted to kill people," he casually told a
reporter over a mess-tent dinner of turkey cutlets in February 2006. "The
truth is," he said, shrugging, "it wasn't all I thought it was cracked up
to be. I mean, I thought killing somebody would be this life-changing
experience. And then I did it, and I was like, `All right, whatever.' I shot


                                   293

                          B O O K F O U R : D I S C O V E R Y

a guy who wouldn't stop when we were out at a traffic checkpoint and
it was like nothing. Over here, killing people is like squashing an ant. I
mean, you kill somebody and it's like `All right, let's go get some pizza.' "
Green concluded, "See, this war is different from all the ones that our
fathers and grandfathers fought. Those wars were for something. This
war is for nothing."
   Despite the fact that Green made no effort to hide his blood lust, the
reporter, Andrew Tilghman from the army's Stars and Stripes newspaper,
found the violently psychotic conversation little more than routine. "I just
saw and heard a blunt-talking kid," he said, and thought little more of it.
   A few months later, the "blunt-talking kid" saw an attractive fourteen-
year-old Iraqi girl and ran his index finger down her cheek as she stood
frozen in fear. Thin and tall, Abeer Qasim Hamza al-Janabi lived with her
family in a farmhouse about a thousand feet from the checkpoint where
Green worked, just outside the sunbaked Sunni village of Mahmudiyah,
twenty miles from Baghdad. The soldiers would enter the farmhouse fre-
quently under the pretext of searching for "terrorists" but were in reality
attempting to get close to Abeer, which means "fragrance of flowers."
They would smile, give her the thumbs-up sign, and say, "Very good, very
good."
   Then, on the night of March 12, 2006, Green and four of his army bud-
dies, including Specialist James Barker, twenty-three, and Sergeant Paul
Cortez, drank cheap local Iraqi whiskey mixed with an energy drink and
played cards. Between hands, they planned an attack on the girl and her
family. After hitting golf balls, they changed into dark clothing and aban-
doned the checkpoint to go "kill and hurt a lot of Iraqis," according to one
of the men involved. Green grabbed a loaded Russian-made AK-47 rifle,
snatched from a dead Iraqi, to use for the killing, figuring the murders
would be blamed on fellow Iraqis. Another conspirator stayed behind to
monitor the radio and warn them if there was trouble.
   Inside Abeer's house, Green forced the girl's parents and five-year-old
sister into a bedroom, where he shot the father several times in the head,
the mother several times in the abdomen, and the sister in the head and
shoulder. "I just killed them, all are dead," Green boasted to his friends.
As Green killed her family, Abeer was in another room being brutally
gang-raped by Cortez and Barker. "Cortez pushed her to the ground. I
went towards the top of her and kind of held her hands down while Cortez


                                        294

                                  E X T R E M I S

proceeded to lift her dress up," Barker later admitted. Cortez added, "I
lifted up her skirt and took off her stockings while Barker held her hands
with his knees. After I was done, myself and Barker switched spots." As
Abeer screamed and cried, Barker shouted at her to "shut up" in Arabic.
Then as Cortez stood lookout, Green raped Abeer and then shot her in the
head. Cortez poured kerosene onto her body and attempted to light her
and the house on fire to cover up the massacre. On the way back to the
checkpoint, where Barker grilled chicken wings, Green tossed the AK-47
into the canal.
   Despite a clumsy attempt by army superiors to cover up the crime,
details of the grisly murders and the premeditated involvement of U.S.
soldiers eventually came to light. Brutalized by the long occupation and
outraged by the rape and murders, local farmers became part of the Is-
lamic State of Iraq (ISI), a large umbrella group of Sunni insurgents cre-
ated as a reaction to the U.S. invasion and occupation. Meeting in the
fields near the Euphrates River, their operational plan tacked to a tree, the
men set their sights on avenging the death of Abeer and her family. They
chose the early morning hours of May 12, 2007, near Mahmudiyah, not
far from where the slaughter took place.
   On the night of May 11, 2007, two U.S. Humvees took up positions
on a lonely stretch of asphalt road in the lush agricultural area on the
outskirts of Mahmudiyah. Located in the flat and arid Euphrates River
Valley, this area is where the Iraqi desert gives way to soggy irrigation ca-
nals and palm trees towering above tall grass. At twilight and in the early
morning, it bore an odd resemblance to the rice fields of Vietnam. Parked
about 165 feet apart, with their vehicles and gun turrets facing opposite
directions, the men, four in each vehicle, were there to keep a lookout for
anyone planting explosive devices in the road. It was the third night in a
row soldiers had parked in the same spot.
   Just after 4:00 a.m. on Saturday, a sleepy time in the morning when
no one in either vehicle was up in the gun mounts keeping a lookout,
about fifteen Iraqis met at a farmhouse, picked up their weapons, and
then quietly made their way to the road. Once there, they cut through ra-
zor-wire coils, snuck into the unguarded space between the two vehicles,
and hurled grenades into the open turrets. The muffled blasts shattered
the tranquil night and plumes of fire shot out of the open turrets like
the flick of a lighter in a darkened room. From inside each burning hulk


                                      295

                         B O O K F O U R : D I S C O V E R Y

came the sound of machine-gun fire as the heat cooked off rounds of
ammunition. While most of the men were killed instantly, or died in the
subsequent firefight, a few managed to escape and were quickly captured
at gunpoint--one of the key aims of the ambush. The Iraqis then planted
explosive booby traps around the burning vehicles, hoping to slow down
any responding U.S. troops. "The attack was extremely bold," said Major
Robert Griggs, the group's operations officer. "It really is amazing how
good the enemy was."
   Among the first to arrive after the attack was First Lieutenant Morgan
Spring-Glace, who expected to find eight bodies. "No one thought there
would be an abduction," he said. Among the missing was nineteen-year-
old Byron W. Fouty, a private from Waterford, Michigan, who dropped
out of high school, had trouble finding work, and joined the army as a
last resort. "Maybe he thought by joining the army it was regular pay,"
said Cathy Conger, the mother of one of Fouty's close friends. Once in
Iraq, however, Fouty quickly realized he had made a big mistake, espe-
cially after learning that his tour there had been extended from twelve
months to fifteen months. "George W. Bush has decided that another 3
months in this [expletive] is worthwhile," he wrote on his MySpace blog
a month before the attack. "This pisses me off to a level I haven't been
in a long time." He added, "Last June I decided to join the Army. Ha,
another wrong turn."
   Another missing soldier was Private First Class Joseph J. Anzack Jr. of
Torrance, California. A high school football player with little interest in
academics, he was gung ho to join the army soon after graduation. But
like Fouty, he also quickly began developing second thoughts, which he
expressed when he came home for Thanksgiving about six months before
the attack. "He kept saying, `God, I don't want to go back,' " said his aunt,
Debbie Anzack. "It was going to another country, everything that was
expected of him, the fact that people were trying to blow him up." Finally
there was Specialist Alex R. Jimenez, twenty-five, of Lawrence, Massa-
chusetts, who as a boy played regularly with little green plastic soldiers
and dreamed of joining the military. It was a dream he accomplished
when he signed up with the army following high school in June 2002.
   In the days and weeks following the ambush and kidnapping, four
thousand U.S. troops and two thousand Iraqi soldiers were mobilized for
a massive door-busting dragnet throughout the region, with some houses


                                       296

                                 E X T R E M I S

being raided multiple times. Women and children were interrogated,
thumbprinted, and forced to submit to retinal scanning, while more than
a thousand Iraqi men were detained for questioning. At the time, the gov-
ernment of Iraq was already holding at least twenty-four thousand prison-
ers, nearly all of whom had not been convicted of any crime or even had a
trial. The United States was holding approximately twenty-six thousand
prisoners under the same conditions.
   Instead of finding cooperative residents, the battalion only found the
body of one of the missing soldiers floating half naked in the Euphrates
River, a few kilometers south of where the battle took place. The lifeless
remains were those of Private First Class Joseph J. Anzack Jr., the high
school football player from Torrance, California. In a posting on their
website, the captors gave the reason for the attack. "You should remember
what you have done to our sister Abeer in the same area," it said. They
also released a videotape that showed the military identification badges
of the two missing soldiers, above which was Arabic script. "Bush is the
reason for the loss of your prisoners," it said. The voice then said, "After
the three soldiers were alive as prisoners they became dead bodies." The
speaker also referred to the inability to obtain the bodies of their own
dead from the U.S. military. "Because you disdain to give us the corpses
of our dead," he said, "so we will not give you the corpses of your dead,
and their residence will be under the soil, God willing."
   As the six thousand U.S. and Iraqi troops pounded on doors and placed
handcuff straps on hundreds of suspects, the NSA was also searching for
anyone involved in the kidnappings. Immediately after receiving word of
the capture on Saturday, May 12, the agency began focusing both regional
and national intercept capabilities on the area. At NSA Georgia, all ears
were on Mahmudiyah. By Sunday, intercept operators were beginning to
develop a number of leads connected to the Islamic State of Iraq, and on
Monday agency officials went to the FISA court and asked to amend an
existing order--apparently adding ISI to a list of terror groups. Approval
was granted within hours.
   A short time later, analysts came up with a list of names associated
with ISI, including the name of one of the suspected kidnappers, a man
who went by the moniker Abu Rus. Intelligence officials believed he had
masterminded an earlier assault in the area and he was also a suspect in
the downing of a U.S. helicopter in April 2006. Army general David H.

Petraeus, the top U.S. commander in Iraq, would later confirm that the
military had identified the person chiefly responsible for the abduction.
"We know who that guy is," he said. "He's sort of an affiliate of al-Qaeda.
He's the big player down in that area. We've tangled with him before."
  But targeting the suspects proved a problem. That spring, several FISA
court judges reviewed the opinion of the friendly judge who ruled in the
administration's favor in January and came up with a very different inter-
pretation. "We have to get an update every ninety days," said McConnell.
"Subsequent judges started to define it a little more narrowly." In fact
they rejected the earlier interpretation and insisted that a strict reading of
FISA required an order, including a showing of probable cause, before
the NSA could begin intercepting the ISI e-mail traffic. "Originally the
court seemed to be complicit in what Bush and those guys were doing but
then they got a ruling saying, knock it off," said one senior intelligence
official.
  It all had to do with location. At least some of the e-mail likely passed
through U.S.-based ISPs, such as Yahoo or Gmail, triggering the statute.
"So what we found is we were actually going backwards in our ability to
conduct our surveillance," McConnell complained, "which was requiring
a warrant for a foreign target in a foreign country. And the issue was the
wording of the law from '78. If it touched a wire in the United States, we
had to have a warrant. That was the basic issue."
  A second problem stemmed from the fact that the actual intercept was
conducted on U.S. soil, either at NSA Georgia or in one of the NSA's
secret telecom rooms. "Where we intercept the communications has be-
come a very important part of the determination," said McConnell. It was
a section of FISA that was little noticed during the Cold War because
nearly all of the NSA's listening posts were located overseas, and thus
unaffected by the restriction. But beginning in the mid-1990s under Mc-
Connell, most of the NSA's foreign bases were closed and consolidated
stateside in Georgia, Texas, Colorado, and Hawaii. Later, secret intercept
rooms were established in domestic telecom facilities, such as the AT&T
hub in San Francisco.
  Despite the unfavorable ruling, the FISA court gave the NSA a grace
period of a few weeks. "We had a stay until the end of May," said McCon-
nell. After that, the agency was back to operating as it did pre-9/11. Thus,
with every minute counting, attorneys in the NSA's Office of General


                                        298

                                 E X T R E M I S

Counsel quickly began to put together an emergency FISA application.
All that was required was the signature of the attorney general before
the targeting could begin. The agency would then have three full days
before it would be required to obtain a regular FISA order. At 10:00 a.m.
on Tuesday, representatives from the NSA met with other intelligence
officials to discuss how best to target the ISI suspects. Fifty-two minutes
later, the agency formally notified Justice of its desire to begin the inter-
cept operation. To the agency's surprise, some of the names were already
being surveilled under a preexisting FISA order. Finally, at 12:53 p.m.,
the NSA's general counsel signed off on the emergency FISA request to
begin targeting of the remaining names, certifying that all of the probable
cause requirements had been met.
   But rather than quickly get the document signed and start the surveil-
lance, Bush administration lawyers and intelligence officials spent the
next four and a half hours debating and discussing how to go about it.
Thus it was not until 5:15 p.m. that they began looking for a signature
and by then key officials were out of reach. Attorney General Gonzales
was in Texas addressing a United States attorneys' conference and the
solicitor general, who was then the acting attorney general, had already
left for the day. Rather than call him back in, the decision was made to
attempt to reach Gonzales in Texas. That mistake cost another two hours
as the Justice Department's command center called back and forth to the
staff but were unable to actually speak to the attorney general. Finally, at
7:18 p.m., Gonzales authorized the emergency request and the FBI was
immediately contacted. Ten minutes later, bureau officials notified the
NSA and at 7:38 p.m. the names were placed on the watch list and the
targeting finally began.
   The system had descended into chaos, and this time lives depended on
it. Because of the spring FISA court ruling "we lost about two-thirds of
our capability," complained McConnell. "We were in a situation where
we couldn't do our basic function of providing warning or alert to stop
an attack." This was because so much of the world's communications--
especially Internet traffic--passes through U.S. switches and routers. "If
you were to look at a map of the world by bandwidth, it would show that
the United States is the center of the world," said McConnell.
   Then, once the new court ruling took effect on June 1, the agency had
to begin performing a sort of triage on the intercepts. Massive amounts


                                     299

                          B O O K F O U R : D I S C O V E R Y

were flowing in, but analysts were able to target only a small number
because of the need to obtain a FISA order on those selected. "We were
in extremis," McConnell complained. "American soldiers were captured
in Iraq by insurgents and we found ourselves in a position where we had
to get a warrant to target the communications of the insurgents . . . What
we did do was, as the numbers got smaller, we prioritized in a way that
we kept the most important, the most threatening, on coverage. And we
worked very quickly to try to catch up, and what we found is [that] there's
so much volume that we were falling further and further behind."
   Realizing the mess that was developing, a few months earlier the Bush
administration had finally decided to go to Congress and seek to modify
FISA--something they could have done at the very beginning. Six years
earlier, following the 9/11 attacks, the administration could have simply
and quickly updated the law with virtually no opposition. Instead, led
by Cheney and Hayden, the White House came up with its supersecret
make-up-the-rules-as-you-go warrantless eavesdropping program. Now,
more than half a decade later, the program was no longer secret because
of the New York Times leaks--leaks driven by its illegal nature. At the
same time, the war was in an upward death spiral, the president's national
ratings were below sea level, and Congress was in the hands of angry
Democrats. It was a bad time to at last seek legislation, especially where
much of it involved "trust us."
  "In his normal dick-measuring contest with Congress, Cheney's big
mantra was trying to reclaim executive power that he thinks the executive
branch lost after Watergate," said one senior intelligence official. "And
so their whole thing was we don't need your permission or your coopera-
tion. He completely overplayed his hand, they painted themselves into
this corner, and I would argue that they would ultimately get less out of
this than they would have gotten if they brought Congress in early on. I
would argue that they would have gotten more than they're going to end
up getting."

C   hosen as the administration's chief lobbyist for the NSA eavesdrop-
    ping program was the former NSA director and retired vice admiral
Mike McConnell, now the newly appointed director of national intelli-
gence (DNI). Born on July 26, 1943, in the foothills of the Blue Ridge
Mountains in Greenville, South Carolina, McConnell was the son of a
progressive textile worker who, in the 1930s, promoted union organi-
zation and civil rights. In the early 1960s he attended the local college,
Furman University, where he slept in a closet in the school's gym while
managing the basketball team. After graduating with a degree in econom-
ics in 1966, during the war in Vietnam he joined the navy. "My father was
in World War II, my uncles were in Korea," McConnell said, "and so it
was a war and it never entered my mind that I wouldn't do anything other
than what my family had done, [which] is to volunteer."
   Shortly afterward, McConnell shipped off to Vietnam as a damage
control officer on the USS Colleton, a ship attached to the Mobile Riv-
erine Force in the Mekong Delta. A decade later, while assigned as the
operations officer for the Fleet Ocean Surveillance Information Facility in
Rota, Spain, in 1976, McConnell received his first initiation into the world
of signals intelligence. "Four navy chiefs and one NSA civilian took me
under their wing to teach me Sigint," he recalled. "I learned as a young
navy lieutenant that Sigint is hard; it is complex, esoteric, and difficult to
understand over its depth and breadth . . . It changed my understanding,
respect for, and use of Sigint for the rest of my professional life."

   In 1992 McConnell was named director of the NSA, where he oversaw
the downsizing of the agency at the start of the post­Cold War years. He
also found that it was far easier to eavesdrop than to convert the intercepts
into finished, usable intelligence. As always, code breaking--referred to
as processing--was the hardest part. "I have three major problems," Mc-
Connell was often heard declaring, "processing, processing, and pro-
cessing." He also got his first taste of the new world of communications.
"When I went there, it was all wireless. We listened to people around the
world. I left four years later, it was all wire."
  After retiring from the NSA, McConnell became a senior vice presi-
dent at Booz Allen Hamilton, where, during the war in Iraq, he pocketed
$2 million a year selling intelligence and defense services to the Penta-
gon and the spy community. Among the company's major contracts was a
$63 million data mining operation for John Poindexter's discredited Total
Information Awareness program.
   Personable, soft-spoken, and courtly, with a mouth that seems con-
stantly in a frown, McConnell has light-brown hair and a slight stoop
when he walks. He took over as spy czar in February 2007. With the
bulk of the intelligence work now being outsourced to private industry, it
came as little surprise that Bush would choose an industry kingpin to run
the intelligence community. But the driving force behind McConnell's
selection was actually Cheney, who needed a good salesman to push
Congress into passing a weakened and watered-down FISA bill to the
administration's liking. The two had become close when Cheney was
secretary of defense under the first President Bush and was responsible
for McConnell's appointment as NSA director. In his new job, McCon-
nell had to change his sleep patterns. "I get up at 4:00 every morning," he
said. "I try to get to bed by 10:00 or 11:00 at the latest. And you do the
math; that kind of makes it a full day. Why do I get up at 4:00? I have to
brief the president at 7:30 to 8:00, six days a week."
   McConnell argued against having a public debate on the issue of war-
rantless eavesdropping. Nevertheless, like Cheney and Bush, McConnell
decided to use fearmongering as his principal marketing tool. During an
address at his alma mater, Furman University in Greenville, South Caro-
lina, for example, the DNI warned the students that a horde of Iraqi and
Pakistani terrorists might be conspiring to wipe out their university and
kill them all. "Today, terrorists in Pakistan . . . would like nothing more


                                        302

                                  I M M U N I T Y

than to obliterate this campus," he said. "If they're planning with the ter-
rorists in Iraq, more often than not, the communications will flow through
the United States. So we've got foreign terrorists in Pakistan talking to a
foreign terrorist in Iraq who wants to attack the members of this audience
and a law said, `Mike McConnell, you can't listen to that.' "
   Then following the kidnapping of the soldiers in Iraq, McConnell
made the incident a part of the administration's sales pitch to Congress.
In closed session, he warned legislators that the NSA had lost precious
time in the first critical hours--time that could have been spent looking
for the suspects. "It took time," he said, because of the FISA requirement,
to demonstrate to the attorney general that the target was likely an agent
of a foreign power. By the time the NSA obtained the legal permission
for the tap, he said, it was no longer useful. "Some Americans are going
to die," he said, unless the administration got its way.
   The theme was then picked up and spread by the Republicans, who
eventually convinced many in the public that FISA was responsible for the
soldiers' fate. "The intelligence community was forced to abandon our sol-
diers because of the law," a senior congressional staffer told the New York
Post. "How many lawyers does it take to rescue our soldiers?" he asked sar-
castically. "It should be zero." The family members of the kidnapped sol-
diers, understandably upset, also joined in. "This is terrible. If they would
have acted sooner, maybe they would have found something out and been
able to find my son," said Alex Jimenez's mother, Maria Duran. "Oh my
God. I just keep asking myself, where is my son? What could have hap-
pened to him? . . . They should change the law, because God only knows
what type of information they could have found during that time period."
   But the reality was far different from the sales pitch. It wasn't until
10:00 a.m. Tuesday morning, three days after the attack, that the NSA
first began working on the paperwork for the emergency application and
by 12:53 p.m. they were finished. All that was needed was the signa-
ture of the attorney general or the acting attorney general. According to
Royce Lamberth, the former presiding judge of the FISA court, "The
attorney general can immediately implement a surveillance by notifying
the court." But rather than get that done and begin the surveillance, the
Justice Department wasted the afternoon talking about the issue, then
couldn't locate the acting attorney general, and spent another two hours
trying to find Gonzales. Rather than blame the delay on the slow-moving


                                      303

                          B O O K F O U R : D I S C O V E R Y

Justice Department, however, McConnell argued to Congress that it was
the new FISA requirement that was gumming up the works and risking
the lives of American soldiers.
  The tactics worked. As members of Congress were racing for the door
to start their August recess, the Bush administration was able to ramrod
through both chambers a temporary FISA reform containing the changes
they wanted. These included giving the NSA, for the first time, the au-
thority to eavesdrop without a warrant not just on overseas targets call-
ing or e-mailing into the country, but also on Americans communicating
overseas, as long as the target is "a person reasonably believed to be
located outside of the United States." Thus, if a person in Chicago calls or
e-mails someone in London, the NSA could now eavesdrop on that con-
versation or read that message without a warrant, as long as the agency's
target is the person in London.
  This was a substantial expansion of the law and basically stripped
authority away from the FISA court by giving the attorney general and
McConnell the power to approve international surveillance, rather than
the eleven judges. The only role for the court would be to review and ap-
prove the procedures used by the NSA after the eavesdropping had been
conducted. It would have no authority to examine the justification for the
individual cases. The law also gave the Bush administration additional
power to force the telecom industry to cooperate with such spying op-
erations. The companies could now be compelled to cooperate by orders
from the attorney general and McConnell.
  The Protect America Act was passed during a Saturday session on Au-
gust 4 but not signed into law by President Bush until the next morning.
At that point, the NSA raced to get back up to speed. "It actually took us
about five days to get it all done," said McConnell, "because there were
new procedures, and we had to be very careful, so we had the highest
priority on coverage, and then it took us about five days or so get back to
where we were in January."
   Ironically, it turned out that the changes in FISA apparently had noth-
ing to do with the search for the missing soldiers. The kidnapping took
place on May 12 and the new interpretation of the law didn't go into ef-
fect until June 1. Also, according to Colonel Michael Kershaw, one of the
regional commanders in Iraq who helped lead the search, the key suspect
involved and the initial target of the NSA's search, Abu Rus, was quickly


                                        304

                                  I M M U N I T Y

captured, and it turned out that he had nothing to do with the kidnap-
ping. "The terrorist that really had led the attack against our predecessor
unit," said Kershaw, "we detained him about three weeks after the attack
on our soldiers. We went after his group immediately and were able to
capture him. But the information that we found that was associated with
him led us to believe that he was not involved directly in the attack on
our soldiers."
   Nevertheless, the scare tactics worked and the bill was passed--but
only as a placeholder until permanent legislation could be debated and
enacted. Thus it was set to self-destruct in just six months, at midnight
on Saturday, February 16. As the date approached, the Senate complied
fully and passed the administration's bill, complete with immunity from
prosecution for the telecoms that assisted with the warrantless eavesdrop-
ping program. "Under the president's program, the terrorist surveillance
program," McConnell acknowledged, "the private sector had assisted us.
Because if you're going to get access you've got to have a partner." The
House, however, showed signs of balking. Many members had been se-
verely criticized for running out of town in August instead of fighting
against the Protect America Act and now they were going to take their
time. The House asked for a three-week extension of the act so it could
study the Senate bill, but the White House said it would veto any such
extension, despite the claim that the country would be in mortal danger if
the legislation expired.
   The key issue was immunity for the telecoms, which the House had re-
fused to put in its version of the bill--the Restore Act--and they weren't
budging, despite the fact that it was approved by the Senate. Many be-
lieved that the issue needed to be settled in the courts, not on Capitol Hill,
and it was also an issue important for a number of Democratic support
groups. "The House should stand up to the bullying from the president
and reject the administration's lies and fearmongering," said Caroline
Fredrickson, director of the American Civil Liberties Union's legislative
office in Washington. "Let the American system of justice decide this
case. Do not give the phone companies a `get out of jail free' card. If the
companies really `did the right thing' as the president said, then they have
nothing to fear from going to court." She added, "Terrorism is a threat.
But ignoring the Constitution is also a threat."
   At the White House, the anger and frustration was growing. On Thurs-


                                      305

                           B O O K F O U R : D I S C O V E R Y

day, two days before the deadline, President Bush said he would delay
his planned five-nation tour of Africa to continue pressuring the House
over the immunity issue. "If these companies are subjected to lawsuits
that could cost them billions of dollars, they won't participate, they won't
help us, they won't help protect America," Bush said. He then continued
his fearsome warnings. "At this moment, somewhere in the world, ter-
rorists are planning new attacks on our country. Their goal is to bring
destruction to our shores that will make September the 11th pale by com-
parison." He added, "There is really no excuse for letting this critical leg-
islation expire." Nevertheless, as in a high-stakes game of poker, he again
refused to agree to a three-week extension, insisting on an up-or-down
vote before the expiration of the deadline.
   As the administration's fearmongering escalated, a number of national
security experts, including some who had served in the Bush administra-
tion, publicly challenged the allegations. Among them was Richard Clarke,
the former head of counterterrorism at the National Security Council un-
der Bush; Rand Beers, the former senior director for combating terrorism
at the National Security Council during the Bush administration; Lieuten-
ant General Don Kerrick, former deputy national security advisor; and
Suzanne Spaulding, the former assistant general counsel at the CIA. All
had worked with McConnell in the past. Nevertheless, they wrote that Mc-
Connell and the Bush administration were distorting the truth about NSA
surveillance capabilities after the Protect America Act expired. "The sun-
set of the Protect America Act (PAA) does not put America at greater risk,"
they wrote. "The intelligence community currently has the tools it needs
to acquire surveillance of new targets and methods of communication."
   They also rejected the administration's claim that it was crucial to na-
tional security that the telecoms receive retroactive immunity. "Telecom-
munications companies will continue to cooperate with lawful government
requests, particularly since FISA orders legally compel cooperation with
the government. Again, it is unclear to us that the immunity debate will
affect our surveillance capabilities . . . The Administration has made it
clear it believes this entire debate hinges on liability protection. As previ-
ously stated, it is unclear that liability protection would significantly im-
prove our surveillance capabilities. It is wrong to make this one issue an
immovable impediment to Congress passing strong legislation to protect
the American people."

                                 I M M U N I T Y

   Finally, at midnight on Saturday, February 16, 2008, the law expired.
Thus, six and a half years after Cheney and Hayden secretly took NSA
off course, sending its reputation--and Americans' trust in the agency--
plunging, and possibly violating the law and the Constitution, they were
back to square one. "We have to work the dark side, if you will," Cheney
had said back then. "Spend time in the shadows . . ."
   But with the elections coming up and Democrats worried about being
labeled weak on national security, the Bush administration largely got its
way on July 9 when the Senate went along with the House and passed
the FISA Amendments Act. The new law provides what amounts to legal
immunity to the telecoms, weakens the authority of the FISA court, and
gives freer range to NSA in targeting suspected terrorists abroad.
   To end the more than forty lawsuits brought against them by public
interest groups, the telecoms need only to show a federal judge that they
received written assurance from the Bush administration that the eaves-
dropping was legal, which is basically a formality. Although the NSA
will still have to obtain a FISA order to target Americans, they can now
target foreigners outside the country simply by submitting to the court a
list of suspected terrorist groups rather than individual names. It will be
up to NSA shift supervisors to determine who is a member of the group.
But in a significant concession, Americans abroad now come under the
protection of the FISA court for the first time. Previously, all that was
needed to eavesdrop on Americans outside the country was the permis-
sion of the attorney general; now to listen in on Americans overseas the
NSA will have to obtain a FISA order.
   The vote was seen as both a win for the Bush administration and a
litmus test for Senator Barack Obama, the Democratic candidate for
president. Although Senator John McCain had long supported the bill,
but never bothered to vote on it, Obama had long opposed it and at one
point even threatened a filibuster. But as the date for the vote approached,
Obama said he would support the legislation, causing uproar among his
most ardent followers--more than seven thousand of whom expressed
their frustration on his own Web site and called for him to reverse his de-
cision. "I have watched your campaign with genuine enthusiasm," wrote
Robert Arellano, "and I have given you money. For the first time in my
life, I have sensed the presence of a presidential candidate who might
actually bring some meaningful change to the corrupt cesspool of na-


                                     307

                            B O O K F O U R : D I S C O V E R Y

tional politics. But your about-face on the FISA bill genuinely angers
and alarms me."
   Despite the protest, Obama voted in favor of the bill. His only conces-
sion was a vow, if elected, to have his attorney general do a fresh review of
the NSA's eavesdropping activities. "Given the choice between voting for
an improved yet imperfect bill, and losing important surveillance tools,
I've chosen to support the current compromise," he said. "I do so with
the firm intention--once I'm sworn in as president--to have my attorney
general conduct a comprehensive review of all our surveillance programs,
and to make further recommendations on any steps needed to preserve
civil liberties and to prevent executive branch abuse in the future."
   And so the post-9/11 battle for civil liberties is lost with a promise that
the war will continue behind the scenes of another president's adminis-
tration. It is ironic, for if there is a lesson of the FISA Amendments Act,
it is that presidential power is abundant; it is political courage that is in
short supply.

W   ith the Middle East destined to be the central focus of NSA opera-
    tions for the foreseeable future, shortly after the 9/11 attacks Mike
Hayden took a close look at his limited and dilapidated facilities at
NSA Georgia and called in the architects. As more trailers were set up
to accommodate the growing overflow of personnel, work began on the
blueprints for a sprawling new operational center to eavesdrop on target
countries stretching from Pakistan to Libya.
   Code-named Sweet Tea, the new listening post will include a 501,699-
square-foot operations building containing a workout room, a credit union,
a mini­shopping area, nursing facilities, an eight-hundred-seat cafeteria,
and a new 7,600-square-foot Visitor Control Center. Located at the corner
of 16th Street and Lane Avenue, the new NSA/CSS Georgia was also
designed with the NSA's all-hearing antennas in mind. The location, said
agency documents, "provides the perfect look angles with no possibility
for encroachment to their required line-of-sight in the future." While the
cost of the project has been pegged at $340.8 million, that figure excludes
the purchase and installation of all the new equipment. Once the costly
computers and expensive analytical equipment have been acquired and
wired in place, officials believe the final total could be closer to $1 billion.
The latest projections in 2008 were that the center would be fully up and
running by 2012 and employ more than four thousand workers, making it
the agency's largest facility outside of Fort Meade.
   Inside, the workstations of voice interceptors and data miners that


                                     311

                           B O O K F I V E : F U T U R E

once looked like battlefield command centers, with multiple computers
and monitors crammed together, will now have a single monitor and hard
drive. Until now, for security reasons, separate computer systems have
been needed for different highly classified programs, thereby creating a
physical firewall between them. One system might be used exclusively
for an operation targeting a high-level encrypted Egyptian diplomatic
network while another, less sensitive computer might be used on inter-
cepts from an Iranian naval base. A third might be an unclassified system
connected to the Internet. Switching between hard drives or computers
was both time-consuming and cumbersome.
   But the NSA is now developing a secure "virtualization" platform able
to combine multiple special-access programs on a single workstation.
Analysts will only be able to enter the various sections of the computer
hard drive with unique IDs and passwords. They can also quickly form
password-protected "communities of interest" in the system, such as one
in which only personnel cleared for Operation Highlander intercepts have
access. "What's nice about this platform is I can form these communities
of interest on the fly, make sure that they are secure, and begin to share
information very quickly with other members of that community," said
Chris Daly of IBM's Software Group, which is developing the system
with General Dynamics Corporation's C4 Systems. "Secure virtualiza-
tion ensures that one virtual space on my machine doesn't get contami-
nated by another."
   Another innovation for Arabic voice interceptors at NSA Georgia,
who must sift through at least twenty different dialects, is a new refer-
ence manual called the Arabic Variant Identification Aid (AVIA), which
describes six dialects, Baghdadi Arabic being the latest addition. The
system, created by NSA's Center for Advanced Study of Language, also
comes with voice samples to help identify the origin of the speaker. A
center document says, "A speaker who claims to be Egyptian but who
speaks with a Yemeni `accent' is probably lying. Linguists can use the
AVIA to determine that such a person's speech is really Yemeni rather
than Egyptian."
   The intercept operators will also soon be carrying around Top Secret
BlackBerry-type smart phones. Also built by General Dynamics' C4
Systems, the secure mobile device, known as the Sectéra Edge, will be
capable of handling a variety of classifications, including voice commu-


                                      312

nications at the Top Secret level and e-mail and Web access at the Secret
level and below. "For the first time, authorized military and government
personnel can now wirelessly access both classified and unclassified
voice and data communications on the same device," said John Cole, vice
president of C4 Systems for information assurance. "The Sectéra Edge
is an all-in-one communications solution, allowing users to easily switch
between classified and unclassified information by pressing a single key."
Like a BlackBerry, the smart phone can synchronize information with a
computer and, soon, will be able to accommodate WiFi networks.
   At the quiet groundbreaking ceremony on March 26, 2007, NSA direc-
tor Keith Alexander showed up with Georgia Republican Senator Saxby
Chambliss. Before scooping some dirt with a golden shovel, Chambliss
told the group of electronic spies, "You're doing the Lord's work." Some-
one then asked Alexander about the warrantless eavesdropping program.
"We don't want to spy on Americans, now do we," he said. "We want to
spy on terrorists."
   While NSA Georgia has its ears cocked toward the Middle East and
North Africa, NSA Texas eavesdrops on Central and South America as
well as the Caribbean from a series of buildings and satellite dishes on
the Medina Annex of Lackland Air Force Base. Since the attacks on 9/11,
however, and with Latin America low on the priority list, the facility has
been playing an increasing role in helping NSA Georgia target the Mid-
dle East and also hot spots in Europe such as Bosnia. Like Georgia, the
facility is a consolidation of army, navy, marine, and air force Sigint spe-
cialists, with the air force taking the lead role. And also like Georgia, San
Antonio is about to get an influx of NSA money and personnel.
   The third major listening post in the U.S., focusing on Asia and the
Pacific, is NSA Hawaii. For decades, the facility has been buried under-
ground in a bunker in Kunia, in the center of the island of Oahu, about
fifteen miles west of Honolulu. Originally constructed as an underground
tunnel shortly after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor in December
1941, the $23 million cavern was built to house a bomb-proof aircraft as-
sembly plant. But rather than drill into the ground, the engineers decided
instead to erect a three-story hangarlike structure with a large open bay
area and reinforced concrete walls and then cover it with earth.
   Nicknamed "The Hole," the 250,000-square-foot facility was instead
used as a map-making plant, producing 2,700,000 maps during one very


                                      313

                            B O O K F I V E : F U T U R E

busy month. Then following the war, the navy used the subterranean
compound to store torpedoes and ammo, and later, after extensive reno-
vations, it became a command center for U.S. Pacific forces. Then in
January 1980, the NSA took it over, packed it with receivers and comput-
ers, put the army (and later the navy) in charge, and began eavesdropping
on much of Asia.
   But with the sudden windfall of post-9/11 cash, NSA architects drew
up plans for a massive new facility, similar to NSA Georgia. On August
30, 2007, Director Keith Alexander, wearing a lei around his neck and
holding a long `O'o stick, an early Hawaiian digging tool, broke ground
on the new facility. "Because of the mind-boggling changes in communi-
cation technology over the last two decades, coupled with the disturbing
social and political dynamics, we need more, newer, and better ways to
process intelligence," said Alexander. "This building and its design, in-
frastructure, capabilities, and location will support and protect an unpar-
alleled intellectual combine."
   Located off Whitmore Avenue in Wahiawa, the new 234,000-square-
foot, two-story building is to be surrounded by an "Exclusive Standoff
Zone," an empty area the width of a football field between the facility
and the tall fence that encircles it. The seventy-acre site was formerly the
home of a giant "elephant cage," an enormous circular antenna used for
eavesdropping and direction finding over much of the Pacific. Once the
$318 million facility is completed in September 2010, the twenty-seven
hundred Kunia workers will leave their old bunker and enter the new one,
which will be built partly underground.
   Another highly secret NSA facility undergoing extensive expansion
is its Denver Security Operations Center, located at 18201 East Devils
Thumb Avenue on Buckley Air Force Base in Aurora, just outside Col-
orado's capital city. For decades, a series of four large satellite dishes
in golf-ball-like radomes have served as the downlink for a number of
the agency's most powerful eavesdropping spacecraft. These include a
microwave-only eavesdropping system known as Vortex or Mercury, and
a multifrequency giant known as Magnum or Orion. The two geosyn-
chronous satellites were such behemoths they needed to be launched on
the powerful Titan-IV rocket. The take from these satellites is analyzed
in the attached Aerospace Data Facility, which in 2000 employed about
twenty-nine hundred analysts from all branches of the service as well


                                       314

                                  E X A B Y T E S

as NSA civilians. But like the other listening posts, the Denver center is
undergoing a large expansion.
   At the time of the attacks, the NSA had only about 7 percent of its
facilities outside of the Baltimore-Washington area. The realization that
a series of similar attacks could virtually wipe out the agency caused
Mike Hayden to begin thinking seriously about moving critical parts of
the agency to other areas of the country. Another reason to relocate large
chunks of the agency was power. As the agency began digging through
massive amounts of data, its energy-hungry thinking machines were put
on overdrive. What is likely the world's largest collection of superpower-
ful computers is housed in the Tordella Supercomputer Building, a win-
dowless, two-story, 183,000-square-foot facility on Ream Road at NSA
Headquarters. Keeping the whirring machines from melting is an eight-
thousand-ton chilled water plant. Even before the attacks, all that num-
ber crunching consumed enormous amounts of energy--about the same
amount of electricity as half the city of Annapolis, Maryland's capital.
   Following the attacks, as the NSA began plowing through mountains
of data in its search for terrorists, the agency's already enormous power
demands began running up against Baltimore Gas & Electric Company's
finite amount of energy. The problem was so serious that agency techni-
cians were unable to install two new multimillion-dollar supercomputers
in the Tordella Building out of fear that the NSA's power grid would col-
lapse, blowing the fuse on the entire agency.
   By 2006, the estimates were that such a calamity could be anywhere
from two months to less than two years away. "If there's a major power
failure out there, any backup systems would be inadequate to power the
whole facility," said Michael Jacobs, who was in charge of the code-mak-
ing side of the NSA until 2002. Another longtime agency executive, Wil-
liam Nolte, pointed to the danger of erratic power surges. "You've got an
awfully big computer plant and a lot of precision equipment, and I don't
think they would handle power surges and the like really well," he said.
"Even recalibrating equipment would be really time-consuming--with
lost opportunities and lost up-time."
   As a short-term fix, the agency began considering buying additional
generators and pulling the plug on a number of older computers designed
for code-breaking attacks on Cold War targets. They even began rais-
ing the temperature two degrees during the summer to help alleviate the

strain on the electrical system. Some current and former government of-
ficials pointed the finger at General Hayden for not taking greater action
when the energy problems first began to surface in the late 1990s. "It
fits into a long, long pattern of crisis-of-the-day management as opposed
to investing in the future," said one. Also alarmed was Senator John D.
Rockefeller IV, the chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee. The
NSA officials "were so busy doing what various people wanted that they
forgot to understand that they were running out of power, and that's sort
of a national catastrophe," he said, warning, "We cannot have that place
go dark."
   One potential solution involved an enormous building boom, creating
a poweropolis with a new 50-megavolt amp substation, a 50-megawatt
generator plant, and another 36-megawatt generator plant, on top of the
agency's existing city-size capacity. The other answer was to begin mov-
ing much of the data mining out of Fort Meade to more energy-friendly
parts of the country.
   After months of searching, it was decided to relocate the data center to a
former Sony Electronics computer chip plant not far from NSA Texas. In
what had become a common practice, once the NSA approved of the new
building, it was purchased by Corporate Office Properties Trust (COPT),
a Columbia, Maryland, real-estate investment company that specialized
in leasing buildings to the NSA and its contractors. The firm also owned
much of National Business Park, the office complex across from the NSA
where many of the companies doing business with the agency leased
buildings. The NSA would then lease the former Sony plant from COPT
at a nice profit for the company. "We have become increasingly reliant
on intelligence and defense tenants," said Randall Griffin, president and
CEO of COPT, "particularly due to the increased activity in those sectors
following the events of September 11, 2001."
   COPT paid $30.5 million for the 470,000-square-foot facility, which
Sony vacated in 2003. Located on fifty acres of land, it consists of two
connected former research and development buildings at 1 Sony Drive,
located at NW Loop 410 and Military Drive in northwestern Bexar
County. The company also placed under contract another twenty-seven
acres of adjoining land with the understanding the NSA would likely ex-
pand the facility and construct additional buildings. The NSA's plan was
to spend about $100 million to renovate what it was calling the Texas

Cryptology Center, and then employ about fifteen hundred people to
work there, many hired locally. An initial group of experienced agency
workers would come down to train the new hires in another leased build-
ing, an old Albertsons grocery store near Interstate 10 and Wurzbach
Road in San Antonio.
   The timing of the move was interesting. Although the agency began
looking at the property in 2005 and even signed a lease for the Sony
building, it seemed to be holding back. When asked if the project was still
on track, NSA spokesman Don Webber issued a noncommittal response
regarding the move. "I will not speculate about any changes to NSA's
plans for a new facility for NSA/CSS Texas," said Webber. "As with any
government program, shifting priorities, funding availability, and mis-
sion essentials could always alter the scope or schedule of a planned
project." City officials, worried about losing the facility, traveled to NSA
headquarters in early January 2007. "We told them we were going to
get Microsoft, and that really opened up their eyes," said Bexar County
judge Nelson Wolff. Then on January 18, Microsoft formally announced
its decision to move to San Antonio. Three months later, on April 19, the
NSA issued a quiet press release saying it had finally agreed on the San
Antonio location.
   Both the NSA and Microsoft had been eyeing San Antonio for years.
The city had the cheapest electricity in Texas and the state had its own
power grid, which made it less vulnerable to rippling outages on the na-
tional power grid. Nevertheless, it seemed that the NSA wanted to be
assured that Microsoft would also be there before making a final com-
mitment.
   For an agency heavily involved in data harvesting, there were many
advantages to having their miners virtually next door to the mother lode
of data centers. Microsoft's plan was to build a $550 million, two-build-
ing complex on a forty-four-acre site at 5150 Rogers Road. At 470,000
square feet, the facility was the exact same size as the NSA's data cen-
ter, with each almost the size of the city's Alamodome. One big differ-
ence, however, was in the number of personnel to be employed. As with
most data centers, virtually everything in the Microsoft complex was
automated and thus the company intended to hire only about seventy-
five people to keep the equipment humming. The NSA, however, was
planning to employ about fifteen hundred--far more than was needed to

babysit a warehouse of routers and servers but enough to analyze the data
passing across them.
   On July 30, 2007, under mostly sunny skies, a white stretch Hummer
pulled up to a vacant field in the Westover Hills section of San Anto-
nio. As the door opened, a woman dressed in a white shirt, khaki pants,
and cowboy boots stepped out and surveyed the vast open area. Debra
Chrapaty, Microsoft's corporate vice president for global foundation ser-
vices, then opened the groundbreaking ceremony for the new complex
that, she said, would contain the digital brain for the world's largest soft-
ware company.
  "We're building a cloud," Chrapaty said. "The cloud is not the cloud
in the sky, it's what we're about to break ground on in San Antonio."
Inside the virtual cloud, she said, were tens of thousands of computer
servers through which will pass e-mail, instant messages, photos, videos,
software programs, and details on the Internet searches of millions of
users worldwide. Chrapaty noted that Microsoft has more than 280 mil-
lion Hotmail customers, and its computer systems handle eight billion
message transactions per day. She also said the current plant was only the
beginning and that Microsoft hoped to build a second, identical facility,
bringing the total investment close to $1 billion. The new data center will
be a place "where the Internet lives," said another company executive.
   Microsoft hoped the first phase of the complex would "go live" in
July 2008. When completed, the building will be a mirror image of the
company's new data center in Quincy, Washington, which went live on
March 27, 2007. Like Quincy, the San Antonio complex will be low-key
and secretive, without even a sign to identify it. On the outside, the win-
dowless, beige-colored building will be wrapped in a tall security fence.
   Inside, employees will have to pass through a telephone-booth-sized
security portal containing a biometric scanner that will take a hand im-
pression to match one in the computer. They will also wear badges with
radio-frequency-identification smart chips. Past the lobby, a small group
of workers will oversee the operations of the data center in a glass-en-
closed control room with a wall of monitors. Elsewhere, the building will
consist of long hallways between huge brain centers containing tens of
thousands of computer servers. To keep them a cool sixty to sixty-eight
degrees, each center will have a room with refrigerator-sized air-condi-
tioning units. In the event of a power failure, another room will contain

giant blocks of batteries that would automatically come to life for eigh-
teen seconds before the SUV-sized backup generators kick in.
   As Microsoft broke ground on Rogers Road, 7.3 miles away work-
ers were tearing walls and replacing floors at the NSA's future data
center. In addition to tapping into American communications without a
warrant, General Hayden also wanted to know exactly what Americans
were doing day by day, hour by hour, and second by second. He wanted
to know where they shopped, what they bought, what movies they saw,
what books they read, the toll booths they went through, the plane tickets
they purchased, the hotels they stayed in, and the restaurants where they
ate. In other words, Total Information Awareness, the same Orwellian
concept that John Poindexter had tried to develop while working for the
Pentagon's DARPA.
   Following the scandal that erupted after public exposure of his TIA
project, Poindexter resigned and Congress killed any further money for
the project. But surveillance projects have an uncanny way of coming
back, and rather than die, many of the ideas and concepts simply mi-
grated to the NSA, an agency with a far better track record than DARPA
for keeping secrets. Even though Congress cut off funding for the still-
born program in 2003, it nevertheless authorized some of the research to
continue and allowed TIA technology to be used in the NSA's foreign
surveillance operations. Thus, just as the NSA can rifle through millions
of phone calls under the Bush administration's warrantless surveillance
program, it can also sift through billions of records, such as those stored
at Microsoft's data facility. Such "transactional" data includes websites
visited, queries to search engines, phone records, credit card usage, air-
line passenger data, banking transfers, and e-mail header details.
   Even without the warrantless powers granted by President Bush, ob-
taining personal information has become much easier with the passage of
the Patriot Act and the frequent use of "national security letters," which
do not require probable cause or court approval. In 2000, the number of
NSLs issued was 8,500, a large number. But between 2003 and 2005 the
requests had skyrocketed to 143,074, according to a 2007 Justice De-
partment inspector general's report. The audit found that 60 percent of
a sample of these subpoenas were not in compliance with the rules, and
another 22 percent contained unreported possible violations of the law,
including improper requests and unauthorized collections of information.

The revised CALEA not only makes it a crime for any company, such as
Microsoft, to refuse to cooperate, it also makes it a crime for company
officials to disclose such cooperation.
  While the revelations of such widespread abuse may have come as
a surprise to most Americans, they did not surprise the president of a
small Internet access and consulting business who was one of the many
recipients of a national security letter. "The letter ordered me to provide
sensitive information about one of my clients," he said. "There was no
indication that a judge had reviewed or approved the letter, and it turned
out that none had. The letter came with a gag provision that prohibited
me from telling anyone, including my client, that the FBI was seeking
this information. Based on the context of the demand--a context that
the FBI still won't let me discuss publicly--I suspected that the FBI was
abusing its power and that the letter sought information to which the FBI
was not entitled."
   The executive went to court and fought the order and the FBI eventu-
ally dropped the matter. "But the FBI still hasn't abandoned the gag order
that prevents me from disclosing my experience and concerns with the
law or the national security letter that was served on my company," he
said. "Living under the gag order has been stressful and surreal. Under
the threat of criminal prosecution, I must hide all aspects of my involve-
ment in the case--including the mere fact that I received an NSL--from
my colleagues, my family, and my friends. When I meet with my attor-
neys I cannot tell my girlfriend where I am going or where I have been.
I hide any papers related to the case in a place where she will not look.
When clients and friends ask me whether I am the one challenging the
constitutionality of the NSL statute, I have no choice but to look them
in the eye and lie. I resent being conscripted as a secret informer for the
government and being made to mislead those who are close to me, espe-
cially because I have doubts about the legitimacy of the underlying inves-
tigation." He added, "At some point--a point we passed long ago--the
secrecy itself becomes a threat to our democracy."
   Another 2007 study, this one by the Congressional Research Service
examining the federal government's data mining practices, gave a hint
at the NSA's data dragnet. It cited a statistic from the Web page (now
removed) for the NSA's Advanced Research and Development Activity




                                       320

                                E X A B Y T E S

(ARDA): "Some intelligence data sources grow at a rate of four petabytes
per month now," the study said, "and the rate of growth is increasing." As
noted in the opening of this book, in a year at that rate, the database would
hold at least 48 petabytes, the equivalent of nearly one billion four-door
filing cabinets full of documents. It would also be equal to about twenty-
four trillion pages of text.
   Eric Haseltine noted in 2004 that even the NSA's enormous computer
power has trouble keeping up with the flow. "We can either be drowned
by it or we can get on our surfboard and surf it and let it propel us. And,
of course, that's what we're trying to do."
   According to a University of California, Berkeley, study that measured
data trends around the globe, the NSA does a lot of surfing. In 2002, there
were 1.1 billion telephone lines in the world producing close to 3,785 bil-
lion minutes--equivalent to 15 exabytes of data. At the same time, there
were also 1.14 billion mobile cellular phones producing over 600 bil-
lion wireless minutes, or another 2.3 exabytes. Then there's the Internet,
which in 2002 contained about 32 petabytes of data and had about 667
million users who sent and received about 532,897 terabytes of informa-
tion, including 440,606 terabytes of e-mail.
   To analyze such amounts of information flowing into the agency's
rapidly filling databases, the NSA and ARDA came up with a number
of TIA-like exploitation systems including one called Novel Intelligence
from Massive Data (NIMD). The program focused on the development
of data mining and analysis tools to be used in working with enormous
quantities of information. "Novel Intelligence" refers to a potential key
piece of a puzzle that had not previously been known. "Massive Data"
is measured either by size--one petabyte and above--or by complexity,
such as multimedia, audio, maps, graphics, video, spoken text, equations,
and chemical formulas or a combination all jumbled together.
   At the heart of NIMD is a piece of software called the Glass Box that sits
on analysts' workstations and captures much of their online research pro-
cess--the searches, results, downloads, documents viewed, and locations
where data is sent. Based on the data captured in the Glass Box, models
are created to automate and improve upon the analysts' techniques. Simi-
lar analytic functions can then be automated and implemented on vast
bodies of data. The ultimate goal would be to have, in essence, robotic




                                    321

analysis "of streaming petabytes of data"--such as that flowing across
the Microsoft servers or through AT&T's OC-192 pipes. This "data tri-
age" would then make "decisions about which data to store, which to
elevate for immediate analysis, and which to delete without further at-
tention." If fully implemented on U.S. communications and data links,
it would create a society where everyone's words and actions would be
screened by secret surveillance machines programmed to watch-list any-
one who matches a complex algorithm created by a secret agency.
   In the same way that the NSA is drowning in useless data, it is also
unable to keep its head above water in analyzing voice communica-
tions. Despite decades of research, the agency has still not perfected the
capability to effectively spot key words or phrases in voice telephone
conversations. There are just too many and they go by too fast. Even at
the agency's Middle East listening post in Georgia, where the hunt for
Osama bin Laden was priority one, the eavesdropping was still conducted
the old-fashioned way--analysts such as Adrienne Kinne would manu-
ally listen to each call. There were far more calls, however, than there
were analysts to listen.
   Nevertheless, the science of telephonic word spotting is progressing
both within the agency and in the outside world. Among the leading com-
panies in the field is Natural Speech Communication (NSC), which, like
Verint, Narus, and NICE, is a company based in Israel, the eavesdrop-
ping capital of the world. Founded by Ami Moyal, a participant in the
Wiretappers' Ball, the company has sold its eavesdropping products to
a number of unidentified Western intelligence services. "The NSC Spot-
ter is currently deployed in several agencies around the world," says the
company. According to Moyal, "We don't pretend that we can compete
against the U.S. National Security Agency, but we have a supplementary
product." Like the other Israeli bugging companies, NSC also has ex-
tremely close ties to Israeli intelligence. Among the five members of the
company's board of directors is Shabtai Shavit, who served as head of
Mossad from 1989 until 1996, and since then has been an advisor to the
Israeli National Security Council and to the subcommittee on intelligence
of the Knesset.
   "NSC's technology is a fascinating technology that can upgrade intelli-
gence and monitoring systems all over the world," said Shavit. "NSC has
a unique solution for the analysis of huge amounts of audio data in real


                                       322

                                 E X A B Y T E S

time for security operations that depends on immediate response. Also,
word-spotting technology has big potential in additional markets dealing
with large quantities of audio and video data. I believe that the right use
of this technology will create a big change in the way audio is analyzed
and mapped these days and will enable the full utilization of valuable
information hidden in audio data."
  According to the company, NSC's keyword-spotting technology has
the capability to monitor in real time an enormous number of phone calls.
"With increasing volumes of audio streams that require monitoring," says
the company, "keyword spotting is the only way to address the need of
handling hundreds of thousands of calls per day. KWS can assist human
agents to focus on the most relevant calls thereby optimizing the moni-
toring process. This frees the agents from working on irrelevant material,
leading to better utilization of human resources . . . These organizations
are inundated with a huge amount of audio sources that require constant
monitoring. Since there is such a large amount of data, using only human
resources is not an option. KWS technology enables these organizations
to scan and prioritize the audio material so that the most significant con-
versations are handled first."
   For the NSA, a particularly appealing feature of the NSC keyword-
spotting software is its availability in a variety of Arabic dialects. "This
included recording a large, representative database of Arab speakers of
the Levantine dialect," says the company, "spoken by Israeli Arabs, Jor-
danians, Lebanese, and Palestinians. A particular problem was collecting
the colloquial spoken form of the language as used in everyday speech,
and not the classical standard forms found in read speech."
  Another company deeply involved in targeting phone calls, and closely
linked to the NSA, is Nexidia Inc. But rather than conducting real-time
word spotting on multiple voice communications channels, Nexidia spe-
cializes in analyzing, at enormous speed, the content of calls already
recorded. According to the company, it can search through phone calls
"169,000 to 548,000 times faster than real time." Thus, says Nexidia, "the
technology can render over eight thousand hours of audio data searchable
per day." Among the company's first customers was the NSA, and sitting
on the board of directors is the NSA's former director Ken Minihan.
  Also, among the grants and contracts awarded to the company's
founder, Mark A. Clements, were several from the NSA, including one

titled "Analysis of Whispered Speech," which he worked on from January
2000 until August 2003. From the title, the NSA might have had George
Orwell's classic dystopian novel 1984 in mind. In his book, Orwell wrote,
"Any sound that Winston made, above the level of a very low whisper,
would be picked up by it . . . You had to live--did live, from habit that
became instinct--in the assumption that every sound you made was over-
heard and, except in darkness, every movement scrutinized." Mindful of
the limitations of Orwell's Big Brother, the NSA is apparently determined
to prevent even low whispers from escaping their microphones.

W    ell beyond word spotting, NSA is also developing another tool that
     Orwell's Thought Police might have found useful--an artificial in-
telligence system designed to know what people are thinking. With the
entire Internet and thousands of databases for a brain, the device will be
able to respond almost instantaneously to complex questions posed by in-
telligence analysts. As more and more data is collected--through phone
calls, credit card receipts, social networks like Facebook and MySpace,
GPS tracks, cell phone geolocation, Internet searches, Amazon book pur-
chases, even E-Z Pass toll records--it may one day be possible to know
not just where people are and what they are doing, but what and how they
think. The system is so potentially intrusive that at least one researcher
has quit, citing concerns over the dangers in placing such a powerful
weapon in the hands of a top-secret agency with little accountability.
   Known as Aquaint, which stands for "Advanced QUestion Answering
for INTelligence," the project was run for many years by John Prange,
an NSA scientist at the Advanced Research and Development Activity.
Headquartered in Room 12A69 in the NSA's Research and Engineering
Building at 1 National Business Park, ARDA was set up by the agency to
serve as a sort of intelligence community DARPA, the place where John
Poindexter's infamous Total Information Awareness project was born.
Later named the Disruptive Technology Office, ARDA has now morphed
into the Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity (IARPA).
   A sort of national laboratory for eavesdropping and other spycraft,


                                    325

                             B O O K F I V E : F U T U R E

IARPA will move into its new 120,000-square-foot home in 2009. The
building will be part of the new M Square Research Park in College Park,
Maryland. A mammoth two-million-square-foot, 128-acre complex, it is
operated in collaboration with the University of Maryland. "Their budget
is classified, but I understand it's very well funded," said Brian Darmody,
the University of Maryland's assistant vice president of research and eco-
nomic development, referring to IARPA. "They'll be in their own build-
ing here, and they're going to grow. Their mission is expanding."
   If IARPA is the spy world's DARPA, Aquaint may be the reincarna-
tion of TIA. After a briefing by Hayden, Cheney, and Tenet on some of
the NSA's data mining programs in July 2003, Senator Jay Rockefeller
IV, the vice chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, wrote a con-
cerned letter to Cheney. "As I reflected on the meeting today," he said,
"John Poindexter's TIA project sprung to mind, exacerbating my concern
regarding the direction the administration is moving with regard to secu-
rity, technology, and surveillance."
   The original goal of Aquaint, which dates back to the 1990s, was sim-
ply to develop a sophisticated method of picking the right needles out of a
vast haystack of information and coming up with the answer to a question.
As with TIA, many universities were invited to contribute brainpower to
the project. But in the aftermath of the attacks on 9/11, with the creation
of the secret warrantless eavesdropping program and the buildup of mas-
sive databases, the project began taking on a more urgent tone.
   In a 2004 pilot project, a mass of data was gathered from news sto-
ries taken from the New York Times, the AP news wire, and the English
portion of the Chinese Xinhua news wire covering 1998 to 2000. Then,
thirteen U.S. military intelligence analysts searched the data and came
up with a number of scenarios based on the material. Finally, using those
scenarios, an NSA analyst developed fifty topics, and in each of those
topics created a series of questions for Aquaint's computerized brain to
answer. "Will the Japanese use force to defend the Senkakus?" was one.
"What types of disputes or conflicts between the PLA [People's Libera-
tion Army] and Hong Kong residents have been reported?" was another.
And "Who were the participants in this spy ring, and how are they related
to each other?" was a third. Since then, the NSA has attempted to build
both on the complexity of the system--more essay-like answers rather
than yes or no--and on attacking greater volumes of data.

                                T R A I L B L A Z E R

  "The technology behaves like a robot, understanding and answering
complex questions," said one former Aquaint researcher. "Think of 2001:
A Space Odyssey and the most memorable character, HAL 9000, hav-
ing a conversation with David. We are essentially building this system.
We are building HAL." A naturalized U.S. citizen who received her PhD
from Columbia, the researcher worked on the program for several years
but eventually left due to moral concerns. "The system can answer the
question, `What does X think about Y?' " she said. "Working for the
government is great, but I don't like looking into other people's secrets. I
am interested in helping people and helping physicians and patients for
the quality of people's lives." The researcher now focuses on developing
similar search techniques for the medical community.
   A supersmart search engine, capable of answering complex questions
such as "What were the major issues in the last ten presidential elections?"
would be very useful for the public. But that same capability in the hands
of an agency like the NSA--absolutely secret, often above the law, re-
sistant to oversight, and with access to petabytes of private information
about Americans--could be a privacy and civil liberties nightmare. "We
must not forget that the ultimate goal is to transfer research results into
operational use," said Aquaint project leader John Prange, in charge of
information exploitation for IARPA.
   Once up and running, the database of old newspapers could quickly be
expanded to include an inland sea of personal information scooped up by
the agency's warrantless data suction hoses. Unregulated, they could ask it
to determine which Americans might likely pose a security risk--or have
sympathies toward a particular cause, such as the antiwar movement, as
was done during the 1960s and 1970s. The Aquaint robospy might then
base its decision on the types of books a person purchased online, or chat
room talk, or websites visited--or a similar combination of data. Such a
system would have an enormous chilling effect on everyone's everyday
activities--what will the Aquaint computer think if I buy this book, or
go to that website, or make this comment? Will I be suspected of being a
terrorist or a spy or a subversive?
   Collecting information, however, has always been far less of a problem
for the NSA than understanding it, and that means knowing the language.
To expand its linguistic capabilities, the agency established another new
organization, the Center for Advanced Study of Language (CASL), and


                                        327

housed it in a building near IARPA at the M Square Research Park. But
far from simply learning the meaning of foreign words, CASL, like
Aquaint, attempts to find ways to get into someone's mind and under-
stand what they're thinking. One area of study is to attempt to determine
if someone is lying simply by watching their behavior and listening to
them speak. According to one CASL document, "Many deception cues
are difficult to identify, particularly when they are subtle, such as changes
in verb tense or extremely brief facial expressions. CASL researchers are
studying these cues in detail with advanced measurement and statistical
analysis techniques in order to recommend ways to identify deceptive
cue combinations."
   Another area of focus explores the "growing need to work with foreign
text that is incomplete," such as partly deciphered messages or a cor-
rupted hard drive or the intercept of only one side of a conversation. The
center is thus attempting to find ways to prod the agency's cipher-brains
to fill in the missing blanks. "In response," says the report, "CASL's cog-
nitive neuroscience team has been studying the cognitive basis of work-
ing memory's capacity for filling in incomplete areas of text. They have
made significant headway in this research by using a powerful high-den-
sity electroencephalogram (EEG) machine acquired in 2006." The effort
is apparently directed at discovering what parts of the brain are used when
very good cryptanalysts are able to guess correctly the missing words and
phrases in a message.
   Like something out of a B-grade sci-fi movie, CASL is even trying to
turn dull minds into creative geniuses by training employees to control
their own brain waves: "The cognitive neuroscience team has also been
researching divergent thinking: creative, innovative and flexible thinking
valuable for language work. They are exploring ways to improve diver-
gent thinking using the EEG and neurobiological feedback. A change in
brain-wave activity is believed to be critical for generating creative ideas,
so the team trains its subjects to change their brain-wave activity."
   Now that the NSA has begun undertaking remote assassinations,
CASL is also attempting to find ways to better identify who exactly is
speaking before the CIA blows him or her up with a Hellfire missile, as
they did with al-Harethi and his companions in Yemen. "CASL research-
ers," says the report, "are applying sociolinguistic knowledge to speaker
recognition and identification technology. The team developed a protocol


                                         328

                               T R A I L B L A Z E R

for conducting a forensic exam to bring in insights from phonetics, socio-
linguistics, speech analysis and culture. In addition, the team is working
on a sociolinguistic ontology, or an organized system for representing
the social variables--race, gender, age, etc.--that interact with linguistic
variation."
   Aquaint, Novel Intelligence from Massive Data, Glass Box, cogni-
tive neuroscience research, brain-wave control, speaker recognition, and
many more projects are all part of Trailblazer, the code name for the
NSA's rapid push to modernize its eavesdropping operations in a digital,
cellular, fiber-optic world. Hayden had originally picked Trailblazer over
the rival system Thinthread, which would have given the agency a greater
ability to trace the origins and destinations of phone calls and e-mail.
Unfortunately, Trailblazer, launched in 2000, started out bad and only
got worse.
   The first contracts, worth $197 million, went to a little-known soft-
ware company that only eighteen months earlier was operating out of
the owner's basement. The company, Conquest, was founded in 1989 by
Norman G. Snyder, a former agency employee, in the basement of his
Severna Park, Maryland, house. It had the advantage of being close to the
Denny's restaurant in Laurel, where the company's executives held their
weekly meetings. "Five or ten years ago NSA would have never chosen a
company like Conquest," said Snyder, who later moved the company to
the agency's National Business Park.
    Later, many of the NSA's giants--SAIC, Boeing, Computer Science
Corporation, IBM, Litton--came on board. But Trailblazer was plagued
from the start with huge cost overruns and long delays and things never
got better. Hayden indicated that one of the key problems was that they
were eavesdropping on far more information than they could ever process.
"We've had pretty good success with the front end in terms of collection,"
he said. "The more success you have with regard to collection, the more
you're swimming in an ocean of data. So what Trailblazer was essentially
designed to do was to help us deal with masses of information and to turn
it into usable things for American decision makers. There is no other ele-
ment out there in American society that is dealing with volumes of data
in this dimension."
    Hayden and his corporate partners quickly realized they were no lon-
ger swimming but drowning in that data ocean as the cost overruns began


                                       329

                            B O O K F I V E : F U T U R E

mounting. When the agency's inspector general looked at the problem,
he found "inadequate management and oversight" of private contractors
and overpayment for the work that was done. "The costs were greater
than anticipated, to the tune of, I would say, in the hundreds of millions,"
Hayden acknowledged. "The slippages were actually more dramatic than
the costs. As we slipped, the costs were pushed to the right. But we un-
derestimated the costs by, I would say, a couple to several hundred mil-
lion in terms of the costs. Again, it was what we actually encountered
doing this. It was just far more difficult than anyone anticipated." Hayden
also said that the agency tried to do too much too fast. "We learned," he
said, "that we don't profit by trying to do moon shots, by trying to take
the great leap forward, that we can do a lot better with incremental im-
provement, spiral development."

                           Turbulence



U   pon becoming director in August 2005, Lieutenant General Keith Al-
    exander decided to learn from Hayden's mistakes and take a much
more piecemeal approach to the problem of the three troublesome Vs
of signals intelligence--volume, velocity, and variety. Rather than one
unified theory of Sigint, as Trailblazer was intended to be, Alexander
focused more on mastering the individual pieces of the system. "I think
the way to do it efficiently is smaller steps, more rapidly done, rather
than try to take one big jump and make it all the way across," he said, "[in
terms of] how you handle data, how you visualize that data and how we
jump from industrial-age analysis to the information-age analysis that our
country needs."
  "The new idea of Trailblazer, the follow-on to Trailblazer, the big pie-
in-the-sky supersecret follow-on is now called Turbulence," said one
senior official familiar with the program. Soon after it was established,
Turbulence lived up to its name as Congress began raising questions.
"NSA's transformation program, Trailblazer, has been terminated because
of severe management problems, and its successor, Turbulence, is expe-
riencing the same management deficiencies that have plagued the NSA
since at least the end of the Cold War," said one document prepared by
the Senate Armed Services Committee in March 2007.
  A month later, Alexander received the results of an internal survey that
appeared remarkably similar to a nearly identical study carried out when
Hayden first arrived at the agency eight years earlier. "What we need is


                                   331

                           B O O K F I V E : F U T U R E

fundamental change in the way we manage NSA and what we expect of
management and ourselves," said the task force, which was led by George
"Dennis" Bartko, the agency's deputy chief of cryptanalysis. The agency
lacked a "unity of purpose," was facing an "identity crisis," and failed to
produce a "fundamental management culture change." The twenty-eight-
page classified document referred repeatedly to a lack of direction and
cohesion among both management and the workforce. "We do not trust
our peers [coworkers] to deliver," it said. "Fragmentation has undermined
corporate [NSA management] trust. Lack of trust is on display in NSA
organizational structures [and] behaviors across the Enterprise."
   Among their solutions, the twenty-four members of the panel recom-
mended that the agency "decide upon a common purpose, develop plans
and strategies aligned with that purpose, manage all of our resources, and
tie rewards to successful execution of our plans." Bartko, in a separate
column he wrote in an agency publication, pointed out the seeming lack
of progress from the earlier, Hayden-era report. "If these recommenda-
tions were made before, what's different this time?" he asked rhetori-
cally, adding, "Now is the time" for change. "It has to be. The Nation is
depending on us not only today, but tomorrow as well."
   But most troubling was the lack of oversight. "There is no clear mea-
surement and no accountability for execution performance," said the task
force. That may have been a factor in another report that measured mo-
rale within the intelligence community. The survey found that only 46
percent of senior managers within the intelligence community were satis-
fied with the "policies and practices of your senior leaders," and only 43
percent of NSA managers.
   Ironically, despite the call for accountability, the room within the
agency reserved for the Government Accountability Office, the Congres-
sional watchdog agency, remains vacant. "We still actually do have space
at the NSA," said Comptroller General David M. Walker, the director of
the GAO. "We just don't use it and the reason we don't use it is we're not
getting any requests [from Congress], you know. So I don't want to have
people sitting out there twiddling their thumbs."
   At the same time that the NSA is becoming less accountable, it is be-
coming more and more depended upon--due in large part to the lack of
useful human intelligence coming from the CIA. Now just one agency
among many in the intelligence community, the CIA's lackluster perfor-


                                      332

                               T U R B U L E N C E

mance became starkly clear when it was forced to shutter nearly all of
its multimillion-dollar front companies throughout Europe because they
were not producing any useful intelligence. The fronts, posing as invest-
ment banks and other companies, were to serve as cover for clandestine
service officers attempting to develop sources and information. But in-
stead of intelligence the front companies only produced large bills, lead-
ing to the closure of ten out of a dozen offices. Critics saw the failure as
just one more example of an agency out of touch with the times. "I don't
believe the intelligence community has made the fundamental shift in
how it operates to adapt to the different targets that are out there," said
Republican congressman Peter Hoekstra of Michigan, the number two
person on the House Intelligence Committee and normally a strong de-
fender of the agency.
   Considering the CIA's failures leading up to the attacks on 9/11, its
bumbling on the weapons of mass destruction question leading to the
war in Iraq, and now its lack of credible human intelligence on terrorism
despite billions being added to its budget, the agency was quickly becom-
ing more of a liability than an asset. As a result, Bush and Cheney began
turning instead to the NSA and Turbulence to lead both the intelligence
war and the cyberwar. "Bush told Alexander that he wanted `a Manhat-
tan Project' on this," said the senior official with knowledge of the pro-
gram. Bush as well as Cheney, who had become very close to Alexander,
pushed the NSA chief to go hard on the offensive.
   Not only is Alexander the country's top eavesdropper as director of
the NSA, he is also the nation's hacker in chief as commander of the lit-
tle-known Joint Functional Component Command for Network Warfare
(JFCC-NW). A highly secret element of the U.S. Strategic Command, it
is America's cyberwar center, located at the NSA. While the air force
also runs a cyber operations center at Lackland Air Force Base in Texas,
the Air Force Information Warfare Center, its focus is largely defensive.
At the NSA, the emphasis is penetration, exploitation, and attack. "They
have had some pretty good success in terms of monitoring networks and
going in and collecting and going in and leaving things behind," said the
official.
   In addition to viruses designed to covertly tap into networks, the things
left behind could also potentially include such things as virulent strains of
software viruses and logic bombs that remain dormant until a predeter-


                                     333

                             B O O K F I V E : F U T U R E

mined time. Once they come to life, they destroy a computer's data from
the inside. Shortly after he retired as director of the NSA, Mike McCon-
nell, now the director of national intelligence, said he knew of more than
a dozen people who could "do major damage" to a nation by mounting a
computer attack with just a few weeks' preparation.
   Aware of the NSA's increasing involvement in cyber warfare, in March
2008 Russian president Vladimir Putin signed several executive orders
designed to protect secrets on government computer networks from at-
tack by restricting connections between international and domestic com-
puter networks. Similar to a practice long employed by U.S. intelligence
agencies, the measures restrict the ability of computers with access to
"state or official secrets" to connect with networks that travel outside of
the country. The decree stipulates that all "information systems, informa-
tion and telecommunications networks, and computer equipment used to
store, process or transmit information that contains state secrets or infor-
mation from a state agency that contains official secrets," may not operate
on networks connected to others that travel outside Russia's borders.
   The NSA's heavy involvement in cyber warfare dates back to 1996,
when then CIA director John Deutch announced plans to create a "cy-
berwar" center at the NSA. "The electron," Deutch warned, "is the ulti-
mate precision-guided weapon." The Information Operations Technology
Center was created at the NSA in 1999 and became the leading organi-
zation for network exploitation and attack. Then in July 2002, President
Bush signed a top-secret order directing the national security community,
including the NSA, to develop, for the first time, rules and policies gov-
erning how the United States would launch cyberattacks against foreign
computer networks.
   Known as National Security Presidential Directive 16, the order allows
the president to launch a secret preemptive cyberwar against any number
of foreign countries, from China to Pakistan. "I think the presidential
directive on information warfare is prima facie evidence of how seriously
the government does take cyber warfare," said John Arquilla, an associ-
ate professor of defense analysis at the Naval Postgraduate School and an
expert on unconventional warfare. "It also marks a shift away from a far
more prudential approach to information warfare. In the last administra-
tion, there was a great concern about using techniques of cyber warfare
that would then be emulated by others, and, by suggesting to the world


                                        334

                                 T U R B U L E N C E

that the Americans think this is a legitimate form of warfare, others might
want to begin doing this as well. There was a great deal of concern about
that." As the most cyber-connected country in the world, the U.S. has
more to lose by starting an endless cyberwar than any other nation.
   The NSA sends its "global network exploitation analysts" to train at
the agency's Network Exploitation and Target Development Bootcamp.
Then, at the National Cryptologic School, they take such courses as "Ul-
timate Web Hacking" and "Ultimate Web Hacking Advanced." Many of
the cyber warriors are outsourced from the agency's major contractors
lining its National Business Park.
   "Turbulence is working much better," said a knowledgeable official
in 2008. "Trailblazer they tried to start off too comprehensively. What
they're doing with Turbulence is they're starting out with little test pro-
grams and trying to take those and see where they go and expand on them.
If they work, expand them, if they don't work, shitcan them. Spend small
amounts of money on certain ideas, see if they work, if they don't work,
forget it; if they do work, move on to the next idea. And they try to ex-
pand those things out through the system. With Trailblazer, they tried to
design a comprehensive system from day one. Alexander's thing is don't
start with the big concept, start with little ideas, see how they work and
see if you can sustain them." Most of the new Turbulence projects, he
said, deal with network attacks. "They are mainly more ways of automat-
ing things to go into computers, burrow into computers, and then confuse
the computer once you get it going. More sophisticated ways to do that
kind of thing."
    By moving into the world of cyberwar, the NSA has crossed another
dangerous threshold. Corrupting or destroying another nation's data net-
work is considered by most countries an act of war. And in a world where
all networks are intertwined like a ball of string, once a well-disguised
virus is set loose on one system, it may quickly spread to others, including
those in the U.S. Like warrantless eavesdropping and mega­data mining,
it is a legal and technical landscape virtually unexplored by Congress and
society.
    But if the NSA is light-years ahead of the laws of the United States, it
still must obey the laws of physics--although it is coming close to get-
ting around those laws also. According to an internal study, in order for
the agency to be able to handle the enormous amounts of data projected


                                       335

                             B O O K F I V E : F U T U R E

in the near future, its computers will have to accelerate enormously--to
petaflop speed, a quadrillion mathematical operations a second, long the
Mount Everest of computing. With such a capability, the agency would
likely be able to search through much of the world's telecommunications
and computer networks looking for keywords on a real-time basis. But as
silicon chips reach their finite limit in capacity, and as the supercomputer
industry gives way to massively parallel computing, the agency is looking
for ways to reinvent the computerized wheel.
   In the spring of 1976 the first Cray-1 rolled out of the Cray Research
production plant in Chippewa Falls, Wisconsin, and directly into the
basement of the NSA. A second was quietly delivered to the NSA's se-
cret think tank, the Communications Research Division of the Institute
for Defense Analysis at Princeton University. With a random-access
semiconductor memory capable of transferring up to 320 million words
per second, or the equivalent of about twenty-five hundred three-hundred-
page books, the computer could not have been a disappointment. And
when it was hooked up to the computer's specialized input-output subsys-
tem, the machine could accommodate up to forty-eight disc storage units,
which could hold a total of almost thirty billion words, each no farther
away than eighty millionths of a second.
   By the mid to late 1980s, the pace of supercomputer development was
barely giving the NSA enough time to boot up its newest Cray megama-
chine before a new one was wheeled into its basement "flophouse." But
as the demand grew for faster--and cheaper--machines in the 1990s,
universities and high-end companies turned to massively parallel com-
puters containing a thousand or more processors, each as powerful as a
traditional minicomputer. The shift meant trouble for Cray as the world
turned to subcompacts, with fewer and fewer takers for its supercharged
Rolls-Royces.
   Following the worst financial year of its life, in which it was forced to
cut nearly a quarter of its employees, and facing an uncertain future, Cray
Research called it quits. It was acquired by Silicon Graphics Inc.--later
known simply as SGI--a Mountain View, California, manufacturer of
powerful, high-performance workstations, the sort of machines that be-
came Cray's greatest competitor.
   As the supercomputer business began crashing, worries increased at
the NSA. Massively parallel processing might have been a good solu-


                                        336

                                T U R B U L E N C E

tion for some high-end commercial businesses, but it was insufficient for
the NSA's specialized needs. "High end computing systems don't scale
well when they're put in clusters, and they tend to be fragile, with a lot
of reliability issues," said Steve Scott, chief technology officer at Cray.
According to a Pentagon report on supercomputing and the NSA, "Large
supercomputers have always been the only way to solve some really big
`capability' problems." These massive number crunchers, known as vec-
tor computers, were the engines that powered the agency's unique code-
breaking machines--machines that stripped away the tightly welded steel
that encased the secret intercepted messages flowing into the NSA. As a
result, for decades the agency had quietly underwritten a large portion of
the supercomputer industry.
   The nervousness at the NSA increased substantially in 1999 as SGI
appeared to be on the verge of going belly up while still under contract
to build the agency's newest supercomputer, the Cray SV2. At the Pen-
tagon, a special task force of the Defense Science Board was convened
to look into pumping cash into the company to keep the SV2--and NSA
codebreaking--alive.
  "The Task Force concluded that there is a significant need for high
performance computers that provide extremely fast access to extremely
large global memories. Such computers support a crucial national crypt-
analysis capability," said the study. "The vector supercomputing portion
of the capability segment of the high performance technical computing
market is at a critical juncture as far as U.S. national security interests
are concerned. If the current Cray SV2 development slips its schedule or
is unsuccessful, this vector market will be lost to the U.S. with the result
that only foreign [Japanese] sources will be available for obtaining this
critical computing capability . . . While the Task Force considers the de-
velopment of the SV2 to be a very high-risk venture, we believe the DoD
should continue to pursue its development because the potential payoff
is so great--two orders of magnitude improvement--and the required
investment is reasonable."
   The decision to underwrite the SV2 was welcomed at the NSA with a
collective sigh of relief. "The United States is committed to maintaining
and building on its long-held position as the global leader in supercom-
puting," said the NSA's chief scientist, George Cotter. "These powerful
computers are absolutely essential to U.S. national security interests. To


                                      337

                            B O O K F I V E : F U T U R E

that end, the U.S. government is committing significant support to SGI's
Cray SV2 program." The new system was expected to dramatically ex-
tend the capability of the NSA's supercomputers with exceptional mem-
ory bandwidth, interconnections, and vector-processing capabilities. Its
peak speed was estimated to be in the tens of teraflops (trillions of calcu-
lations per second), faster than any supercomputer in existence.
   In 2000, SGI finally threw in the towel and sold Cray Research to the
Seattle-based Tera Computer. In a sense, Cray had gone full circle, end-
ing up in the hands of another maverick with a dream of building the fast-
est machine on earth. This time it was Tera's founder and chief scientist,
Burton J. Smith, a large, rumpled man who had stunned many in the field
by building a machine that in 1997 set a world speed record for sorting
integer numbers. The rebirth of what was now called Cray Inc. was good
news for the NSA. The agency was said to have played a quiet role in
making the deal happen "because it wants at least one U.S. company to
build state-of-the-art supercomputers with capabilities beyond the needs
of most business customers." Work would thus continue on the NSA's
SV2 with a delivery date scheduled for 2002.
   Another major Cray customer, not surprisingly, was Australia's De-
fence Signals Directorate, their NSA. A Cray document bluntly stated the
DSD's mission: the organization, it said, "filters all telephone conversa-
tions, fax calls and data transmissions, including e-mail."
   Following the attacks on 9/11, with the NSA increasing its data intake
exponentially, Hayden began looking beyond the SV2, rechristened the
Cray X1. What he now needed was a new customized system capable
of much greater bandwidth and able to process the Nile Rivers of data
gushing in from the NSA's front-end collection facilities both in the U.S.
and around the world. He also wanted a system that would be a hybrid,
combining the best of both parallel and vector processing. The answer
was a colossal Cray machine code-named the Black Widow. Made up of
sixteen tall cabinets crammed with thousands of processors, the computer
was painted jet black with a splash of red. In September 2003 Hayden
gave his approval for the system, for which the NSA was paying $17.5
million--about the size of the agency's entire budget in its early years.
   According to an Office of Science and Technology document, the
Black Widow system "will provide outstanding global memory band-
width across all processor configurations and will be scalable to hundreds


                                       338

                                T U R B U L E N C E

of teraflops. Should be the most powerful commercially available system
in the world at that time." Also called the Cray XT5h, the Black Widow
was targeted to scale to 32,000 processors, versus 4,096 for the X1, and
employ new multistreaming processors (MSPs) allowing it to achieve the
enormous speeds. But while the sixteen closet-sized cabinets were to roll
into the agency's Tordella supercomputer building in 2006, by early 2008
the agency was still waiting for the truck to arrive. Cray hoped to have the
Black Widow in place sometime that year.
   Then in 2010, the NSA expects delivery of the Cray X-3, known as
Cascade. Funded with $250 million from DARPA, it will likely be the
most expensive computer ever created, and the fastest--designed to break
the petaflop barrier with a sustained speed of more than a quadrillion
calculations a second. It had been a long struggle. In 1971, the agency's
CDC 7600 broke the megaflop barrier and fifteen years later, in 1986,
its Cray-2 cracked the gigaflop limit. Then in 1997 its Intel ASCI Red
crossed the teraflop line.
   Finally, in 2008, a military supercomputer called Roadrunner reached
the petaflop milestone. The $133 million computer, built by scientists at
IBM and Los Alamos National Laboratory, will be used to solve prob-
lems related to nuclear weapons. But if history is any judge, it is likely
that the NSA will also get their own Roadrunner. If so, they will have to
again increase their power supply; the machine uses up about three mega-
watts of power, about what a large shopping mall consumes. According
to Thomas D'Agostino, the administrator of the National Nuclear Secu-
rity Administration, the amount of calculation the Roadrunner can do in
a day is the equivalent to everybody on the planet--six billion people--
using hand calculators to perform calculations twenty-four hours a day,
seven days a week, for forty-six years. But while Roadrunner hit 1.026
quadrillion calculations a second, what the NSA needs is a computer that
will operate at that speed or above constantly, and that is what they hope
Black Widow and Cascade will do.
   But for the NSA, the petaflop barrier may be only a brief way station.
The agency has quietly made it known within the Pentagon that by 2018
it will need a computer capable of exaflop speed--one quintillion (1,000,
000,000,000,000,000) operations a second. To build such a machine for
both the NSA and the Department of Energy, a new computer research
center was launched in 2008. Known as the Institute for Advanced Ar-

chitectures, the facility is run jointly by Sandia and Oak Ridge national
laboratories. "We are faced with some problems for which petaflop su-
percomputers will not be fast enough," said the Sandia National Labo-
ratory computer architect Doug Doerfler. "That's why we need to start
designing an architecture now for exaflop-caliber computing." Among
those potential problems, according to Sandia's Sudip Dosanjh, is power
consumption. "An exaflop supercomputer might need 100 megawatts of
power, which is a significant portion of a power plant," he said. "We need
to do some research to get that down. Otherwise no one will be able to
power one." After exaflops come zettaflops (a billion trillion) and yot-
taflops (a trillion trillion) and beyond that, the numbers haven't yet been
named.
  With its secret intercept rooms, its sprawling data farms, and its race
for exaflop speeds, the NSA is akin to Jorge Luis Borges's "Library of
Babel," a place where the collection of information is both infinite and at
the same time monstrous, where the entire world's knowledge is stored,
but not a single word understood. In this "labyrinth of letters," Borges
wrote, "there are leagues of senseless cacophonies, verbal jumbles and
incoherences."

L  ike a pint-size brain surrounded by a heavily protected, half-million-
   square-foot body, a diminutive Dell computer in the basement of the
National Counterterrorism Center is at the core of the Bush administra-
tion's war on terror. Contained on its tape drive is "the watch list"--the
group of people, both American and foreign, thought to pose a threat to
the nation. At one time the list could be contained on a small 3x5 card
with a great deal of space left over. Today it has grown to more than half a
million names, and it is expanding by the thousands every month. Known
as the Terrorist Identities Datamart Environment, or TIDE, it is the last
stop for the thousands of names vacuumed up in the NSA's warrantless
eavesdropping program as well as its other eavesdropping operations.
  "This is the list that the Do Not Fly list comes from," said one senior
intelligence official concerned about the integrity of the system. "When
that data comes in, it goes out to about six different watch lists. They're
all drawn from that central database. It is an Oracle database sitting in a
Unix operating system. In a nutshell, NCTC is functionally a huge data
warehouse. The only thing that makes NCTC worth anything is the da-
tabase, the TIDE database. This is the most important data since 9/11. If
you screw this up, we know they're out there, we know they're operating,
we know they're trying to get back in. The data is buried in this data-
base."
   Nevertheless, he said, the system is a disaster. The database is incom-
patible with both the NSA and the CIA systems. Despite the ocean of


                                      341

                             B O O K F I V E : F U T U R E

data collected by the NSA, he pointed out, "there really are no interfaces
now so even if they want to send every bit of signal intelligence they
have, we don't have the database structure that can match up the records.
There are point-to-point interfaces between NSA and CIA. It doesn't ex-
ist from NSA to NCTC. That's the problem with data in the intelligence
field--there is no leadership right now."
   The problem, he said, goes back years. "Prior to ODNI [Office of the
Director of National Intelligence] there was no organization that would
say, `All of you guys have to play together electronically.' There were all
these memorandums of agreement that were one-off. The CIA director
would meet with NSA and they'd do a handshake, and NSA would meet
with DIA [Defense Intelligence Agency] and they'd do a handshake. So if
you have sixteen of these major collection systems out there, you can just
see how many of these memorandums of agreement exist today. There
should have been a data architect . . . It's the worst technical screwup I've
ever seen . . . The brains of the U.S. intelligence community reside in that
building out there. The lights are on but nobody's home."
   When CIA employees around the world write intelligence reports, they
send one copy to the CIA's main computer database, code-named Quan-
tum Leap, which is located on a secure floor in an office building in
Reston, Virginia. Another copy goes to the NCTC. But because of the
incompatibility, at NCTC the reports must be printed off the computer,
manually reviewed, and then physically typed into the TIDE database.
"The investment in it's been a couple of hundred million dollars," said
the senior intelligence official. "Not so much the software and even the
machines, but it's all of the people. The CIA had a budget of about a hun-
dred million a year just converting documents to get it in there--basically
cables out of the field. The transmission of those documents to NCTC
was by hand. They literally had no way to connect the two networks, so
they'd print out a big stack of documents and they'd get reentered in the
system. Then they had teams of dozens of analysts going through the
cables . . . They sit there and read them and highlight things with yellow
highlighters and then they go to a data entry team. And then it goes into
an Oracle database, a relational database. And in that kind of database
you can't do a lot of connect[ing] the dots."
   The official also had great concerns about the civil liberties dangers
of the massive database. "The core group is about 40,000, which is the


                                        342

                                   A B Y S S

hard-core, identified," he said. "When you go out at two degrees or three
degrees, meaning friends, family, business associates, it grows to almost
120,000. When you go out four degrees, you're upwards of 400,000. Four
degrees is--I know you, you live in the building, and it so happens that
there is a business in that building that allows me to connect the owner of
that business to another group of another cell. So it's really just using this
technology to establish these connections."
   Because of changes in the law, the rules changed at the NCTC and U.S.
names no longer had to be removed. "Before the FISA thing came down
you would get U.S. citizens and they would have to be flagged and then
they're removed," he said. "When the Patriot Act started it didn't matter.
Before that if someone was a U.S. citizen whether they were hanging out
with Saddam Hussein in Sudan or not, you were required by law to delete
their record in that database. You could not have U.S. citizens in a collec-
tion database. The Patriot Act said if someone's a person of interest and
has a known affiliation to a suspected group, you can track them when the
initial encounter occurred outside the U.S. If it occurred inside the U.S.,
you immediately had to turn it over to the FBI."
   The official said the NSA ran a test with the NCTC in order to see
whether it would be possible to match the NSA's enormous database of
phone numbers--acquired from the phone companies--with the NCTC
list of names. The test was apparently part of the warrantless eavesdrop-
ping program. "We ran a pilot where we ran the data and connected it
with cell phone records. So we knew these people in the U.S. and they
got a whole bunch of cell phone records--matched the names to numbers.
Pretty much we know every cell phone number in the world. But the cell
phone numbers allowed us to connect them to calls inside. So all of a
sudden we had a rich pattern of connectivity. So we have some guy living
in Frankfurt--he makes a lot of calls to six or seven people in Chicago
all the time. Bingo, now you're able to notify the FBI that, hey, you know
those two guys you were looking for? Here's their address.
  "It's what NSA's been doing since 9/11," the official continued.
"They're just sweeping the stuff up. Now you don't have to put in sweeper
rooms to collect this stuff; in many cases you can just go to the phone
company and say, `Give me only those records associated with outbound
calls to this number in Frankfurt.' You get the same data. Frankly, that's
a much better way. All of the telephone company equipment has been


                                     343

                           B O O K F I V E : F U T U R E

standardized since about '86. The telecommunications act. Prior to '86
every switch had its own peculiar data format."
   But the law and policy, he said, have not kept pace with the techno-
logical developments. "They could be snooping on just about anything
right now and not be accountable and be able to hold up their hands and
go, `Our system doesn't track that,' " he said, "when in many cases the
system does but the code is so convoluted you could never know it. What
concerned me is that I started to realize the linkage between what they
were trying to do with the technology and what was going on up on the
policy and the legal level with law. You can't build these systems without
safeguards and controls and they don't have any of that in place right
now."
   Rather than focusing on legal, policy, and civil liberties issues, the
NCTC is focusing its attention on building a bigger database--this one
code-named Railhead--which will absorb TIDE. "The metaphor was
that the Railhead program would be this intersection, this railhead, where
all these data interfaces would converge into the equivalent of a railhead
in a train network," said the senior intelligence official. "It's the largest
program at NCTC, and Railhead and TIDE are about to be fused. Rail-
head is about to eat the TIDE database and when it does that, the TIDE
database will just cease to exist."
   So loose are the criteria for being tossed into the vast sea of names
that in 2007, over twenty-seven thousand were removed, for a variety of
unnamed reasons, because they should not have been in there. How many
other innocent people remain on the list is unknown, but with upwards of
a thousand new names a day being added, the number is likely substantial.
Unlike a bad credit report, there is no way for anyone to ever know they
are in the system--and few ways out of it.
   More than three decades ago, when the NSA posed a fraction of the
privacy threat it poses today with the Internet, digital communications,
and mass storage, Senator Frank Church, the first chairman of the Senate
Intelligence Committee, investigated the NSA and issued a stark warn-
ing:


      That capability at any time could be turned around on the Ameri-
   can people and no American would have any privacy left, such [is]
   the capability to monitor everything: telephone conversations, tele-

  grams, it doesn't matter. There would be no place to hide. If this
  government ever became a tyranny, if a dictator ever took charge in
  this country, the technological capacity that the intelligence com-
  munity has given the government could enable it to impose total
  tyranny, and there would be no way to fight back, because the most
  careful effort to combine together in resistance to the government,
  no matter how privately it was done, is within the reach of the gov-
  ernment to know. Such is the capability of this technology.


  There is now the capacity to make tyranny total in America. Only law
ensures that we never fall into that abyss--the abyss from which there is
no return.

   and Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, Report of the Joint Inquiry into
   the Terrorist Attacks of September 11, 2001 (December 2002), p. 249: "NSA
   Director Hayden testified before the Joint Inquiry that the collection of commu-
   nications between the United States and foreign countries will most likely con-
   tain information about . . . domestic activities and thus . . . is the responsibility
   of the FBI, not NSA. General Hayden contrasted the foreign intelligence value
   of such intercepts and their domestic security value. If the former is at stake, he
   asserted, NSA should intercept the communications; if the latter, the FBI.
       "General Hayden, senior NSA managers, NSA legal staff, and NSA ana-
   lysts made clear in Joint Inquiry testimony and interviews that they do not
  want to be perceived as focusing NSA capabilities against `U.S. persons' in
   the United States. The Director and his staff were unanimous that lessons NSA
   learned as a result of Congressional investigations during the 1970s should not
   be forgotten.
       "Whatever the merits of this position, it was incumbent on NSA and the FBI
   to coordinate so that the full range of intelligence collection weapons in the
   arsenal of the Intelligence Community could have been deployed against the
   terrorist threat. NSA routinely gave the FBI intelligence reporting, and that re-
   porting contained leads about foreign terrorist-related communications. In addi-
   tion, NSA responded to requests from the FBI for such information . . . The FBI
   used NSA-supplied information to advance its investigative interests. However,
   there was no inter-agency procedure in effect to ensure that the FBI made an
   informed decision to cover communications that NSA was not covering."
